OFF-ROAD DRIVING TIPS

Whether you intend travelling to the Pilbara, the Kimberly or out to the Bight the locations
may be vastly different but the off road driving principles remain the same. Your trip can be
safer and free from costly damage to your vehicle by following these driving tips -

First of all find out the overhang distance of your vehicle. This is the distance from the
front of your vehicle to the first point you see on the road in front of the vehicle. The
point in front of the vehicle is calculated with you seated normally in the drivers seat.
You will be surprised at how far this overhang distance extends to the front.

As the road is constantly changing you must learn to search ground quickly and make
decisions on wheel placement early.

Lower your radio aerial to prevent damage or fit one with a spring base.

Search the ground in a rectangular pattern looking from the front as far out as possible
on the drivers-side wheel track and then back in towards the vehicle along the
passenger-side wheel track.

Identify and avoid any object that can damage the tyres or under-body components of
the vehicle such as stumps, sharp rocks, or deep potholes. At times it may be better to
drive a wheel over a large rock rather than have the vehicle straddle it. By doing this
you raise the vehicle’s differential ground clearance and you prevent possible under
body damage by hitting rocks. Assist with this by learning the location of the front and
rear differentials in relation to where you as the driver sit.

Remember where applicable to lock your free wheeling hubs or central differential.

It is a good idea to lower your tyre pressure to around 80% of your highway running
pressure. This will give the tyres a little more flex and grip to mould over rocks and
loose gravel rather than causing the wheels to spin and lose traction, which would
occur if the tyres were left at the hard highway running pressure.

When driving in soft or sandy conditions the lowering of tyre pressures can prevent
bogging. Tyres can be lowered to a minimum pressure of 1 6psi in both split and safety
rims. Tyres must be re-inflated immediately after traversing the obstacle, failure to do
so will lead to tyre damage.

Where you are going up or down a steep hill always engage low range on the transfer
case. For those vehicles that don’t have a low range capability be very careful to
assess the terrain so that you may safely negotiate it.

For those auto transmission 4WD vehicles select low range and lock the gear lever in
low gear whenever descending a steep off-road track.

Drivers of manual 4WD vehicles should remember that depressing or riding the clutch
off-road is fraught with danger.

If you stall or stop the vehicle on a descent you can restart in low range with the
vehicle in gear. Simply turn the key on and do not depress the clutch. Cover the brake
pedal and be ready to apply brake pressure if the vehicle surges forward [common
with fuel-injected vehicles]. This ensures you are under control at all times with the
engine running and gears engaged. Don’t ride the brakes but feather them as required
to slow the rate of descent.
