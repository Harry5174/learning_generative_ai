KNOW THE WARNING SIGNAL AND
HAVE A BATTERY-POWERED RADIO

All Canadian communities where there is a likely need are
provided, or will be provided, with sirens. Other areas should
have warning arrangements based on local systems such as tele-
phones, horns, bells or factory whistles.

Warning devices are only attention-getters. Dependent on the
size of your municipality, the sirens, bells, telephones, etc., will
sound the Attack Warning.

There is one type of siren warning signal in Canada:

The ATTACK WARNING Signal:

The ATTACK WARNING Signal — A wailing (undulating) tone
on the sirens of three to five
minutes duration or short
blasts on horns or other de-
vices repeated as necessary
means:

1. An attack on North
America has been de-
tected;

2. Warning of fallout.

WHEN YOU HEAR THE WARNING SIGNAL, YOU SHOULD
TAKE PROTECTIVE ACTION AND LISTEN TO THE RADIO
FOR INSTRUCTIONS.

A Radio is Essential

When the Attack Warning sounds, you must take protective
action. Take a battery-powered radio with you. Broadcast advice
and instruction may help to save your life. If you don’t have a
portable radio, turn up the volume of your house radio so that it
can be heard in your shelter. If away from home you are forced to
take emergency shelter and are near a radio-equipped vehicle, turn
up the volume and open all the vehicle’s doors or windows.

The Canadian Emergency Broadcasting System, a network of all
Canadian radio and television stations which will be formed when a
nuclear attack on Canada has been detected, will tell you when and
how to take emergency protective action against possible attack
and shelter against fallout if an attack occurs.
