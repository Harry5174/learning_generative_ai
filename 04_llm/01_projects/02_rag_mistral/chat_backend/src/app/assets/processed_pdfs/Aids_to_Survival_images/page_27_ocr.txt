AIDS TO SURVIVAL

Shelter

Extremes of heat and cold are the enemies of human survival and both these qualities are
found in inland arid regions where very hot days can be followed by cold nights. During the
period from 1983 to 1999 fifteen people died due to excessive heat and thirteen due to
excessive cold in Western Australia.

A shelter will provide you with protection from the elements, insects and animals. It is also a
big psychological boost that will help you feel that you are managing. Determine what type of
shelter you require and plan accordingly.

While building your shelter remember that keeping in the shade and moving as little as
possible in the heat of the day can avoid heat stroke and loss of body fluid.

Using Vehicles as Shelter

Vehicles are a source of shelter as they provide protection from the sun, rain and prevailing
weather during the day and the cold air at night. Tarpaulins, blankets or branches can be used
to keep direct sun from the vehicle and interior linings, doors, boot lids and bonnets can also
be removed.

Foil Rescue Blanket
Space and/or rescue blankets are cheap, lightweight and an ideal item to assist in providing
shelter. The reflective surface reflects the sun's rays from the person sheltering underneath.

Natural Shelter
If nothing else is to hand you will have to use bush materials, when constructing a shelter you
should consider the following points â€”

e Type of protection required.
e Availability of materials.
e Proximity of water.

e Close to your emergency signals.

When you begin construction, use larger branches for your basic frame as you will find a roof
fairly heavy when it is wet and they will have to support it. Branches can be tied together
using vines, strips of bark or sword grass. If you are near your vehicle, strip out wires to use
for this.

Remember that your ability to improvise and see alternate uses for items that you may have

available to you could mean the difference between life and death.

TYPES OF SHELTERS

Any survival situation will involve the construction of some form of shelter from the
elements.

The need for shelter and the type of shelter should be identified in your survival situation
appreciation. It is important that you base any decision to build a shelter on your survival
plan.

Note:

Be careful not to use items from your survival kit, which might have a higher priority of
use.
