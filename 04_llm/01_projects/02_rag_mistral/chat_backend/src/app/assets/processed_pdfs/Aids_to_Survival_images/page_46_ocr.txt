THE SOUTHERN CROSS METHOD - AT NIGHT

1. Extending an imaginary line through the long axis

2. Locating the two pointers and bisecting them at right angles with another line.
3. Where these two imaginary lines meet drop a line straight down to the horizon

Direction finding at night using the Southern Cross

NAVIGATING AT NIGHT WITHOUT A COMPASS
You will find it very easy to navigate using the stars, particularly in the more arid regions of
Western Australia.

You will need to establish where north or south is then draw a earth compass on the ground
by drawing a line on the ground indicating north - south, bisect this line with another line at
90°, this will show east and west. You now have your earth compass.

Once you decide in which direction to travel, you can stand on your makeshift compass and
face the direction you intend moving. Look for a bright star or better still, a group of stars that
are in the required direction and move towards them.

Try to select stars that are not right on the horizon as you will lose sight of these when
moving around trees.

Remember that stars move from east to west in the same manner as the sun and you will have
to allow for this at 15° per hour.
Note:

Stop periodically and check your direction by drawing your earth compass on the
ground again.
