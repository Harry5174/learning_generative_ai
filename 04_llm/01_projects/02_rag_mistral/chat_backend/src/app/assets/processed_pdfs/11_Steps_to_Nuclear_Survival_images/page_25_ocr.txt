There are many other points which you and your family must
resolve for a workable survival plan. This booklet provides most
of the essential information on which to base your plans. Read
the Steps again, and, as you review each Step, try to answer the
questions which apply to your surroundings, your home, your
family. Here are a few more which may help:

© Do I know the recommended fire precautions?
@ Does anyone in my family know how to fight small fires?

© Can an emergency supply of water be obtained quickly —
for fire fighting?
for personal use?

e Are first aid supplies and special medicines readily
available?

Does anyone in my family know how to render fist aid?

Can materials for personal hygiene and cleanliness be
gathered near the shelter area quickly?

Do I know what I must do about radioactive dust?

Do I know the emergency plans of my municipality —
for public shelters?

for planned evacuation routes?
for schools, hospitals, welfare centres?

REMEMBER! YOU MUST PLAN FOR:
@ PROTECTIVE ACTION WHEN WARNED OF ATTACK
and
@ PROVISION OF SHELTER AGAINST THE EFFECTS
OF FALLOUT

On the basis of what you’ve read and the questions and answers
you’ve thought about, you should now make your survival plan
and start making whatever arrangements you can. BUT MAKE
SURE THAT ALL MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY KNOW
YOUR PLAN AND WHAT TO DO WHEN THE TIME COMES.

The best way to arrive at a workable plan which will be
remembered by your family is to practise it. If you plan on building
an emergency shelter, try it now to find out if you have enough
material, how much help you’ll need, if your proposed area is
large enough, and how long it will take to build. Locate and
practise moving essential supplies, water, clothing, bedding, etc.
Practise the essential things you would have to do.

If you plan to move to what you consider a safer location, make
a practise run to make sure you know the quickest and safest route,
that protection is available when you get there, and that you can
carry all the supplies you think you'll need.

A GOOD SURVIVAL PLAN IS A PLAN
WHICH YOU KNOW
YOU CAN CARRY OUT

WRITE DOWN THE IMPORTANT PARTS
OF YOUR PLAN

On the following blank pages, list for quick reference the
important things to be done in the event of warning. As examples,
note when and where all members of your family will take shelter
at all times; where essential items of food, shelter and other supplies
will be obtained; how shelter will be improvised; what windows
must be blocked; if you plan on going to what you consider a safer
area, details of the route and supplies you will need at your
destination.
