KNOW HOW TO TAKE SHELTER

It is important to provide your family and yourself with a shelter.
But what kind of shelter? This is a decision you must make yourself
after studying the problem.

Study your shelter requirements in the same way that you would
accident or fire insurance. Decide upon the degree of protection
you want for your family and yourself. Shelter is your insurance
against something you hope will not happen, but if it does, will
give you protection.

Shelters of the type commonly used in Europe during the Second
World War would not provide protection against the blast of a
nuclear explosion. They were designed to withstand short shock
pressures lasting something like 1/100th of a second. Shelters de-
signed to withstand the pressures created by a nuclear explosion
must be able to stand up to pressures lasting as long as 6 seconds.
In addition, they must be capable of giving the occupants protection
against fires outside the shelter as well as against radiation.

The fallout shelter is designed to give protection against radio-
active fallout only. Because most people in Canada probably would

not be affected by the blast and heat effects of nuclear explosions,
protection against fallout is all that is required by them.

The type of shelter for good protection depends upon the
distance it will be from the explosion. Unfortunately, it is not
possible to know this in advance. That is why each individual must
make his own decision when selecting the type of shelter he wishes
to have.

Blueprint for Survival No. 1 gives details of a fallout shelter for
the home in which you now live. If you rent the home, the decision
to construct a shelter must be taken jointly with your landlord.

Blueprint for Survival No. 2 gives details of a fallout shelter for
the new home you may be planning to build.

Blueprint for Survival No. 6 gives details of blast shelters which
may be built outside the home.

These pamphlets are available from your local Emergency
Measures or Civil Defence Organization.

Improvised Protection Against Blast

One of the simplest ways to improvise some anti-blast protection
is to build a lean-to (bed springs or boards) against a work bench
or heavy table, preferably in the basement, and pile mattresses on
it and at the ends. If the material is readily available it could be
built in a matter of minutes after the ATTACK WARNING is
sounded and could protect you from loose bricks, flying glass, etc.
