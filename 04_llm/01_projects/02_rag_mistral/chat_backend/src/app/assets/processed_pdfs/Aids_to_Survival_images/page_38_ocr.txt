The Basket Trap

Freshwater crustaceans [marron, etc] can be caught in simple basket traps baited with animal
entrails or decayed meat and left in position. They should be fitted with a funnel at one end
and tied together at the other. It is important they be weighted down, staked in position or tied
to the bank to ensure they are still there when you check them. To make a basket trap â€”

1. Cut a bundle of green sticks 1m in length and lcm in diameter and mark out a circle
on the ground the size of the end of the trap.

2. Make holes in the ground around the circle with a stick every 4cm and stand a stick
from your bundle in each hole.

3. Weave around the bottom of the trap three times with a long piece of thin green stick
and tie off with cord to keep it together.

4. Tie the top of the trap together with a piece of cord to form a cone shape.
Weave a length of thin green stick around the trap basket fashion.

6. Make a smaller similar cone with the narrow end open and place it inverted inside the
large cone to form a lid and entry.

The Marron Snare

A traditional method of catching marron is to tie a small piece of meat to a length of cord or
fishing line and throw it a metre or two into the water. In clear water you will see the marron
coming to the meat. Once they take the meat they will hang on stubbornly and can be drawn
to the edge of the water and lifted out onto the bank. They can also be caught by using a pole
with a running loop of snare wire tied to the end and placing it over the marron from behind
and dragging them out of the water.

Insects

Insects and their larvae are often overlooked as a source of food even though they are
widespread, a good source of nourishment, have a high food value, high fluid content and are
easy to obtain. Fried termites and ant larvae for instance are a rich source of food.

In some overseas countries, maggots, grasshoppers and termites form part of the natural diet.
Termites can be obtained by picking them up on the end of a wet fingertip after breaking open
anthills or dead wood. The taste of termites and ant eggs is not offensive.

The insect larvae known as the bardy or witchetty grub is obtained by breaking open dead
trees and balga stumps after examining for the characteristic borer holes in the south-west and
by digging up the surface roots of the Witchetty Bush [acacia kempeana] in the central desert
area. They live on the dissolved sugars from the sap of trees, are highly nutritious and are high
in calcium. The entrails should be removed by holding the head in one hand and the tail in the
other then pulling. Other insect larvae may also be present and can be eaten if there is no
offensive smell or taste.

Honey ants can be collected near the base and on the branches of trees in tropical areas. The
fluid from their abdomens is good nourishment as is honey from wild bees if you are lucky
enough to locate any.

Note:

Do not eat furry grubs or grubs with black showing through the skin and remember
that while snails and slugs can be eaten they are an unlikely source of food as they
favour wetter areas and there would probably be better alternate food available.
