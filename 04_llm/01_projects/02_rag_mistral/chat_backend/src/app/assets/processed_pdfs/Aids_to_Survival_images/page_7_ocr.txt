AIDS TO SURVIVAL

CHAPTER 1

Safe Outback Travel

Adequate preparation before undertaking a journey or accepting employment in the outback
will lessen the chance of jeopardising human life. There have been many cases where loss of
life has resulted from a lack of foresight into the problems involved. The WA Police Service
in it’s mission to create a safer and more secure Western Australia provides a service which is
responsive to community needs and is willing to act as a first point of call for safe outback
travel. Members of the public are encouraged to discuss their trip plans and post notifications
with local police.
PRIOR PREPARATION & PLANNING
There are a number of things to be considered before starting to pack for your trip, these are
known colloquially as the ‘Rule of P’ and are linked to the premise that -

Prior Preparation and Planning Prevents Poor Performance.
Equipment Required
The equipment you are taking must be serviceable and sufficient for the trip. Allow additional
equipment if in doubt. Maps should cover the entire area of the trip.
Radio Communications
For close range communication between vehicles a citizen band UHF or VHF radio may be
used, however for long-range radio communication a HF radio is essential, these can be hired
from communications suppliers at reasonable rates. Whilst travelling in the outback it is good
practice to set up a communication schedule with the Royal Flying Doctor Service and
contact them daily advising them who you are and where you are.
Satellite/Digital Telephone Communications
It is now possible to ensure telephone communications in the outback with the introduction of
a system of digital telephones that allow the user to call on his/her digital phone and be
connected automatically to a satellite system with no time delay if in an area not covered by a
digital network. This system has a saturation system of satellites that download to ground
stations and ensure instantaneous voice communication with no time delay between sending
and receiving.

Terrain to be covered
A map study should be done to ascertain —

e Whether it is accessible by vehicle

e Where the fuel and water sources are located

e What is the best route

e What alternate route could you use if necessary
e What aids to navigation will you have

e What positions of evacuation are available

e Where are the local inhabitants
