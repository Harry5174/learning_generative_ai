BUSHWALKING SAFETY

Route plans
All members of the group should have a copy of the route plan and should be aware of any
hazardous sections and ensure all maps are current and accurate

Leaders

If there is a leader appointed they should be competent in all skills required and assistant
leaders must be experienced enough to safely care for the party should something unforeseen
happen to the leader. Both should be conversant with the area.

Medical limitations
Prior to setting off it is essential that the leader of any group be made aware of any medical
condition or any limiting personal factors affecting any member of the group.

Actions-on

In the interests of safety ‘actions-on’ should be set for all foreseeable emergency situations
and all members of the group must know the agreed emergency procedures. It is a good idea
for an individual emergency procedure card to be printed and issued to each person.

Escape Routes
Escape routes should be set prior to departure and must be known and written down by all
members of the group.

Notifications
Notifications need to be posted prior to departure and cancelled on return. Police in the area of
the walk should be notified [it is good practice to discuss your plans with them].

Walking Formation

In the interest of group safety a system of walking in single file through the bush is
recommended rather than having the group walk scattered over a large area where should a
walker be separated from the group he will most likely not be missed until the group stops at
the end of the day.

If the group walks in an orderly line then there is less chance of an individual becoming
isolated.

Navigation tasks should be divided between group members and tasks interchanged regularly
in order to increase team spirit and skill practice. Roles within the bushwalking formation
should be -
