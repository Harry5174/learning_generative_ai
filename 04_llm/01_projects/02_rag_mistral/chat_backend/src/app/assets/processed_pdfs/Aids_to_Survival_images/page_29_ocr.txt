AIDS TO SURVIVAL

Using a tarpaulin for shelter

A tarpaulin can be a valuable aid to providing shelter from the elements as there is no limit to
the uses it can be put to. Remember that tarpaulins today are fairly lightweight and may be
dropped to you by rescue aircraft.

In hot conditions it can be used solely as a base to protect from radiated ground heat when
used in conjunction with any shelter designed to provide shade. Tarpaulins can also be used in
hot conditions to provide deep-shade as the roof of a large A-frame shelter.

In wet, windy conditions they can be used to provide shelter using one end as a base and then
using the remainder of the tarpaulin to provide an outer skin for waterproofing or simply
using as a large A-frame with the edges pegged down or held in place using rocks or logs.

Note:

Tarpaulins need not be used on their own as shelter but can be utilised to supply
additions and improvisations to other forms of shelter that you may decide to build.

Roofing
If your vehicle is handy, you can pull out the head lining to use to make a waterproof roof. If
not, then blankets, sleeping bags or even spare clothes can be used.

Thatching

Waterproofing and shade can be provided using a technique called thatching. This can be
done by using materials such as palm fronds, leafy branches, tufts of long grass, reeds, sedges
and/or long stalked ferns. A good method to employ is called “tuft thatching” using long,
pliable tufts of grass, reeds or sedges. These are better used when dry or partly dry as they
will not shrink and fall apart in windy conditions. To make a “tuft thatch” —

1. Gather the material into small sheaves or handfuls.
2. Bend the end of each sheaf over a batten or long stick.

Twist a few strands of the material around the sheaf a few times and push it through
the bunched up material to hold the sheaf together.

4. Completed “tufts” are then slid along the batten to make a neat thatch.

Each completed batten is then lashed to the frame to provide a wall or roof as required
when used to overlap completed battens.

Use Of Debris

Once you have constructed the skeletal structure for your shelter in cold or wet weather you
should consider the use of debris for protection and insulation. Over the framework heap a
pile of light, soft debris. Leaves, grasses, brush, or any type of leaf litter will do.

The debris should eventually form a large dome shaped mound some 60cm thick over the
structure. Remember the thicker the pile the better the insulation and the steeper the pitch the
better the rain protection. On top of the debris add some bark slabs or moss to form a
protective waterproof layer and to assist in keeping it together.

Low debris shelters built using this method are sometimes called “oven shelters”.
