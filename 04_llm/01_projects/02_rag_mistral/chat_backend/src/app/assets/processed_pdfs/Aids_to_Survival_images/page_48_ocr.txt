AIDS TO SURVIVAL

ELECTRONIC SAFETY AIDS

There are many aids available to the outback traveller and it is worth considering these when
planning for outback travel both on foot and by vehicle.

Radio Communications

For close range communication between vehicles a citizen band UHF or VHF radio may be
used, however for long-range radio communication a HF radio is essential, these can be hired
from communications suppliers at reasonable rates. Whilst travelling in the outback it is good
practice to set up a communication schedule with the Royal Flying Doctor Service and
contact them daily advising them who you are and where you are. Some HF radios also have
an emergency beacon to contact the RFDS fitted.

Satellite/Digital Telephone Communications

It is now possible to ensure telephone communications in the outback with the introduction of
a system of digital telephones that allow the user to call on his/her digital phone and be
connected to a satellite system with no time delay if in an area not covered by a digital
network. This system has a saturation system of satellites that download to ground stations
and ensure instantaneous voice communication with no time delay between sending and
receiving. The Royal Flying Doctor Service has a toll-free emergency Satellite Telephone
number that should be known and recorded as part of your trip plan.

Position Indicator Beacons [EPIRB]

There are several rescue instruments available for the purpose of signalling for assistance,
these include different types of rescue beacons. Travellers in isolated or outback areas should
seriously consider their use. They can be hired from commercial outlets.

Satellite Navigation Systems [GPS]

Global positioning systems are available in Western Australia for purchase or hire. These are
a hand held system that allow you to find your exact position. They also allow you to plan
routes and navigate by giving you a read out of your exact heading and speed over the ground.
Even though the cost may be a factor these units are of obvious value to off road travellers,
particularly when travelling through unfamiliar territory.

Note:

Due to the technical nature of global positioning systems, users are advised to ensure
they understand their operation fully. Map suppliers should be consulted to ensure
that maps used are compatible. Not all maps [particularly older ones] use the grid
system of reference used by GPS.

EMERGENCY SIGNALS

The following methods can be used to indicate your position.

Fires

A smoking fire will aid searchers, both in daylight hours and at night. Extreme care should be
taken when lighting signal fires as some have got out of hand to the extent of causing major
bush fires further endangering survivors and searchers.

Whistle Signals

Distress signal by lost party three blasts together, regularly spaced
Searchers looking for lost party one _ blast at regular intervals
Acknowledgement of distress signal two _ blasts repeated regularly

Recall signal for search parties four _ blasts
