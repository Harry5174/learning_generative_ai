@ On the floor above the corner of the basement you select as
your shelter area, pile any heavy objects you may have
available, such as furniture, trunks filled with clothes, dirt-
filled boxes, books, newspapers, or earth from outside.

® Outside, against above ground walls of the basement around
your shelter area heap earth, sand, bricks, concrete blocks or
packed snow.

If your home has no basement or crawl space, build your
emergency shelter in that part of the house (centre hall or clothes
closet) farthest away from outside walls and the roof. Build it as
described for houses with basements. On the floor immediately
above your shelter area, and against surrounding walls, pile up
furniture, trunks, dressers, dirt-filled boxes or other heavy material
which will reduce radio-active penetration into your emergency
shelter.

DON’T FORGET YOUR BATTERY RADIO

HAVE 14 DAYS EMERGENCY SUPPLIES

Nuclear attacks on centres of production, and fallout conditions,
may curtail the distribution of available food stocks for several
days or even weeks following these attacks. Persons who had
taken shelter against fallout might be advised to stay in their
shelters for as long as 14 days. Those who had chosen to evacuate
larger cities would be dependent largely on the resources available
in reception towns. Because of these possibilities, it is recommended
that every person should have emergency supplies. These supplies
should include food, water, battery-powered radio, first aid kit, arid
where necessary, medical supplies as recommended in Step 7.
Heavy clothing would be necessary in winter. Extra changes of
clothing should be considered particularly stockings and under-
clothing.

For those who may choose to evacuate major centres, supplies
must be selected carefully because of space limitation in the
family car. Supplies should be packaged beforehand so that they
can quickly be put into the car. See the pamphlet “Your
Emergency Pack” available from your local Emergency Measures
or Civil Defence Organization.

Many of the recommended items are already in your home.

Whether you choose to evacuate or take shelter locally, you
should have a road map with you. You could then relate the
information about areas under fallout, which you would hear about
on the radio, to your actual location. Toys, games, books for your
children would help to occupy their time if they had to remain in
shelter from fallout. Your battery-powered radio will keep you in
contact with the outside world.

The following is a suggested list of items from which your two
weeks’ supplies should be developed to be in your shelter or handy
to it.

Equipment
Beds (bunks or folding) Toilet
Bedding Polyethylene bags for toilet
