INTRODUCTION

The Canadian Government has joined other peace-minded nations in
doing everything possible to reduce world tensions, to assist in the settle-
ment of international disputes by peaceful means and to achieve disarma-
ment with such controls as are necessary to preserve the security of all
nations. However, the awesome threat of a major nuclear war involving
North America remains a factor in plans for the defence of Canada,

The nature and scale of a possible nuclear attack on North America, and
the extent to which Canada would be involved in such an attack, cannot be
Predicted with accuracy. Our major centres would be at some risk of
deliberate attack, random explosions could occur, and there would be the
certainty of the danger from widespread, radioactive fallout over most
of the Country.

Governments at all levels have made, and are continuing to make, prepa-
rations which will reduce the number of casualties, safeguard survivors and
contribute to the capacity of this nation to survive and recover from such a
tragedy. The purpose of this booklet is to assist individuals and families in
making personal survival plans and preparations to guard themselves against
the potential dangers of nuclear war.

Many of the precautions which are recommended will serve a double
purpose in that they will save lives in peacetime disasters such as flood,
tornado, fire, hurricane, blizzard, ice storm or earthquake. Attention has
been directed to this important feature throughout the various steps.

All Canadians are urged to read “11 Steps to Survival’ with care to act
on the advice it contains and to keep it handy for emergencies.
