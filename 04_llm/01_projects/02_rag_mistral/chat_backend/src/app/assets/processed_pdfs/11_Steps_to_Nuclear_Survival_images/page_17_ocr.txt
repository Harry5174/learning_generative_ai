Here are some tips for an emergency:

Prepare for emergency by preventing accumulations of trash
and rubbish in and around the home. This would include dry
leaves and grass, lumber, boxes, cardboard cartons, old unused
furniture, bales of newspapers, etc. Keep waste and garbage
in covered containers.

The shaking and twisting of buildings and homes due to
blast waves in wartime or earthquakes and explosions in
peacetime, may break utility inlets at the point they enter the
structure. This may allow gas or fuel oil to flow into base-
ments creating a severe hazard. Do not smoke, strike a match,
or a lighter, to light your way into a darkened basement. Gas
or oil vapours may be present and a violent explosion and fire
may result.

To lessen the danger of fires and explosions follow local
instructions about shutting off utility services when the
ATTACK WARNING sounds.

If you have a coal-burning furnace, or a wood-stove, extinguish
it or at least be sure to close all fuel and draft doors.

Close curtains shutters or venetian blinds on all windows and
remove furniture from window areas.

TO FIGHT AN ORDINARY FIRE:

@ Take away its fuel. Get the burning material out of your home.

© Take away its air. Smother it with a blanket, wet if possible,
or a rug.

© Cool it with water, earth, sand or fire extinguisher.

GAS, OIL, ELECTRICAL FIRES REQUIRE
METHODS:

SPECIAL

© Gas fire. Make sure the gas is shut off and then try to
extinguish anything still burning.

© Oil fires. Make sure the supply is shut off then smother the
fire with earth, sand, rugs or other heavy materials — Don’t
use water.

© Electrical fires. Make sure the electricity is shut off then put
out the fire. Don’t use water if the power is still on.
