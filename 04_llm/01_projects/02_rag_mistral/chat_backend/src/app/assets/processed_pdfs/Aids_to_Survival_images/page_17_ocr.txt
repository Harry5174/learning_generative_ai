AIDS TO SURVIVAL

ACTIONS BY SURVIVORS

While a survival situation will be a traumatic experience for most people the effect it will
have will depend on circumstances. For instance a person suffering a vehicle breakdown in
spring in the southwest region of Western Australia will have a different reaction to a person
who suffers a similar breakdown in mid-summer in the Great Sandy Desert.

Stress and Survivors
Stress is defined simply as reaction to pressure.

Stressors
Events that cause stress are known as stressors, the most important stressors affecting survival
include heat, cold, thirst, hunger, fatigue, boredom, loneliness, fear and pain.

Reactions To Stress

There are natural reactions to stress that need to be recognised, expected and for which
strategic interventions need to be implemented. These include fear, anxiety, anger, frustration
and depression. Do not over-react and remember that too much stress leads to ‘distress’
resulting in anti-social behaviour, angry outbursts, difficulty making decisions, unwillingness
to accept responsibility, an inability to get on with others and eventual withdrawal from the
group.

Initial Critical Reactions

Recognise that you are in a survival situation and don’t be afraid to make an honest appraisal
of the situation. Get your thoughts on track by employing the survival mnemonic and
recognise any survival stressors that are present. Overcome any attitude assumptions [She ’//
be right. It will never happen to me. If anything does happen my instinct, faith and inner
strength will get me through] and adopt a positive attitude. Your life and the lives of others
who are relying on you to do your share are at stake. Remember that your physical strength
and emotional resources are at their strongest in the first three days of survival.

Questions You Should Ask Yourself In A Survival Situation
You should stay focussed on the basic requirements for survival and ask yourself —

e How much water do I have and how will I procure more?

e What shelter from the elements will I need?

e What is the temperature range and will I need a fire for warmth?
e How much food do I have and what food is available?
