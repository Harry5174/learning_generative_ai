AIDS TO SURVIVAL

The desert still method will work without the drinking straw, however to collect the water the
edges of the plastic must be lifted allowing moisture-laden air to escape. The foliage will need
to be replaced when water production falls off. Care should be taken that the plastic sheet
does not touch the foliage as this will prevent the condensed water from running into the
container. Additional fluid such as salt water from salt lakes, urine, etc. can be added to the
hole.

Note:

This method while efficient has the disadvantage of requiring a lot of effort and
subsequent loss of fluid from the body through perspiration and therefore is not
recommended in areas where the transpiration bag can be used.

Distilling Sea Water

If only salt water is available a distilling plant can be made. You will have to improvise and
use containers that can be found or that you may have. First you require a container of
seawater and material to seal the container to prevent steam from escaping. Push one end of
the tubing or rubber hose through this seal material and check to see that the seal remains
intact while blowing into the loose end of the tubing. Place the container onto a fire and bring
to the boil. Steam will be forced through the tube where it condenses and fresh water will drip
from the end, into another container.

The condensation method of distilling water

Another method is to simply bring water to the boil and catch as much steam as possible on a
piece of cloth and then ring it out. Although this method works, it is not the most efficient.

You must remember that the steam is the fresh water and therefore you must trap the steam to
get fresh water. Any improvised method will do even if you place an open container on the
fire and bring it to the boil, and then arrange a small plastic ‘tent’ on top of it. The steam will
strike the tent, condense and run down to your container or containers.

Note:

Alfoil or similar would make a seal around the container by folding it into a cone shape
with the tubing attached to the small end of the cone and placing the large end around
the container, secure ends of cone with wire to make the seal. Run the tubing through
a cooling agent [water].
