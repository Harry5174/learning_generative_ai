KNOW THE EFFECTS OF
NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS

A nuclear explosion releases vast amounts of energy in three
forms:

(a) Light and heat;

(b) Blast;

(c) Radiation.

The amount of energy released depends upon the size and design
of the weapon. A wide range of weapons and delivery systems are
available to an aggressor and we have no way of knowing what size
of explosions might take place in Canada. For illustration purposes,
we describe in this pamphlet the effects of a 5-megaton H-bomb
equal to the explosive force of five million tons of TNT. Such
a bomb could substantially damage the largest Canadian city.

The effects depend upon whether the weapon is exploded high
in the air, or on, or near the ground. An air burst usually produces
more fire and blast-damage than a ground burst which results in a
big crater and more radioactive fallout. The effects described below
are approximate for a 5-megaton explosion and can only be approx-
imate since effects depend upon a number of conditions such as
weather, terrain, etc.

Light and Heat

A blaze of light brighter than the sun is produced by a nuclear
explosion. It lasts for about 15 seconds. Temporary blindness and
eye injury can result from the glare if eyes are not shielded.

The heat rays from the explosion travel at the speed of light or
about 186,000 miles per second. It can start fires up to 20 miles
away. Many fires are caused when the heat pulse comes through 1
window to set fire to curtains, paper, clothing gand furniture, The
heat flash also can set fire to the outside of wooden buildings.

The following are some examples of the predictable effects on
