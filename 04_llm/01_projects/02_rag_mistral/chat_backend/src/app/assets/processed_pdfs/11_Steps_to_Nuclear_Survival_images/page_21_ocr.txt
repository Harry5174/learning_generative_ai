KNOW EMERGENCY CLEANLINESS

Your limited supply of water will have to be rationed and used
only for essential purposes. If you have enough warning time
before the arrival of fallout, fill your bathtub, all available buckets
and pans with water. And remember that there is an emergency
supply in your hot water tank. (Don’t forget this if in peacetime
your water supply has been temporarily disrupted).

The problems of garbage and human waste disposal can be
solved even if fallout keeps you in the shelter. Put all your garbage
in tightly covered garbage pails. After using your emergency toilet,
you should tie human waste in waterproof plastic (polyethylene)
bags and place them in the garbage pail. Store a 14-day supply of
the plastic bags.

After the second day in the shelter, you may risk leaving it for
a few minutes for essential tasks. Therefore, when your garbage
container is filled, move it out of the shelter.

Keep a soft broom in the shelter for tidying it up.

Remember, personal cleanliness in crowded shelter conditions
is important to you and your family.

If your area is free of fallout but is without sewage services,
bury human waste and garbage in the ground. Dig the pit deep
enough so that the waste will be covered by at least two feet of
earth,
