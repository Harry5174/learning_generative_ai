AIDS TO SURVIVAL

ANIMAL BUTCHERY
Most animals can be eaten although most of us have a preference for herbivorous animals

such as cattle sheep, pigs, horses, rabbits and poultry. There is no reason however, that you
cannot eat vermin in a survival situation.

Signs Of Disease

Check all animals for disease, the body should look well fed and be clean smelling. If in
doubt a small piece of meat can be boiled in a covered pot, when the water is boiling if the
vapours have a bad smell you should not eat the meat.

Do not eat birds when the flesh is flabby, purple, a green discoloration around the neck, stiff
feet, collapsed eyes or a sour smell present. If you can pull out a rabbit’s fur, if its eyes are
enlarged and dull or its body cavity slimy it should not be eaten.

PREPARATION & COOKING OF GAME
The size and type of animal will determine your method of preparation for cooking.

Large Animals
Should have the throat cut to 'bleed' the carcass, hung up by the hind legs, the gut contents,
head, and skin removed then cut into joints.

In a survival situation meat can be cooked by boiling, frying, grilling, baking or steaming
depending on what resources are available.

Kangaroo

Kangaroo meat is very low in fat and very high in protein and iron. Because of it’s low fat
content it tends to dry out quickly and must be cooked carefully. Cook it quickly by grilling
over an open fire as steaks or kebabs.

Emu

Emu meat is very low in fat and high in protein, iron and vitamin C. It is red in colour and
similar in texture to lean beef. The tenderness and texture of the meat enables it to be prepared
in many ways. It is best cut into thin steaks and lightly grilled over an open fire.

Rabbits
Should be skinned, gutted and have the head and feet removed. They are best cooked by
inserting a green stick in the body cavity and turning them over hot coals.

Snakes
Should have the head, skin and stomach removed and be cut into pieces. The meat is best
grilled over hot coals.

Lizards
Are prepared simply by removing the head and gut contents. They are best grilled over hot
coals with the skin left on.
Birds
Should be bled as soon as possible after death and have the head, feathers and the intestines
removed. Birds can be cooked by wrapping them in foil from your survival kit, clay, large
leaves or paperbark and placing them in the coals.
Fish
Fish should have the intestines removed and be cooked with the scales and skin on. They can
be wrapped in foil from your survival kit, bark, leaves, mud or clay and cooked in coals.
When cooked the flesh can be accessed by peeling away the wrapping and skin.

Note:

Remember to wash all meat of blood before cooking, make sure that you wash all
blood and meat from your hands after handling dead animals.
