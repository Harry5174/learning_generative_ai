AIDS TO SURVIVAL

Use of Maps

The Western Australian bush is very monotonous with very few landmarks and a lack of
signposts on outback roads. Be wary of spoken directions as they can be misinterpreted and
the wrong track easily taken. In the absence of an official map, try to obtain a rough map
drawn on paper with as many landmarks as possible indicated showing the necessary
distances. Mark your position on the map as you proceed so you can pinpoint your location at
any given time. Do confirm your position at every opportunity.

Weather Conditions

The weather must be considered as many road conditions vary according to the local rainfall.
You should be aware of the changes of season in the area of your trip, this will ensure that
you are going at the best time of year. Check with police or local authorities after rain as
many outback roads can be closed.

Time allowance
You should consider carefully the time and space you are allowing for your trip.

Considerations should include -

e When are you leaving?

e How long will it take?

e Where do you propose stopping to camp?

e When will you arrive?

e Have you allowed a safety margin in case of minor mishaps?

Learn about the country
You should learn as much about the country you are to travel, as possible. This will assist you
if you have to survive in it.

Things to study would be —
e Dangerous animals and reptiles
e Insects, flies and mosquitoes
e Prickle bushes and any poisonous or discomfiting plants
e Any edible wild foods and bush tucker
e Available water sources
e Caves, mine-workings, holes and local problems
e Diseases to guard against

Before leaving on a journey through remote areas always notify friends, relatives, station
owners or police of the following information —

1. Estimated time of departure [ETD]

2. Proposed and alternate routes

3. Estimated time of arrival [ETA]
Note:

Don't forget to notify those concerned once you have safely completed the journey.
