PRESERVING MEAT

The most popular methods used to preserve meat in a survival situation are by drying or
smoking. It must be remembered that only fresh meat should be used to ensure protection
against infection.

Drying meat

Drying meat is a good method for preserving it if you have more than you can eat
immediately. It is also advantageous if it has to be eaten over a period while travelling on foot
as the weight of the meat is reduced by approximately 70%. This is because the water content
of the meat is removed in the drying process leaving behind the tissue containing protein and
nutrients. Dried meat cut with the grain is known as ‘biltong’ and across the grain as ‘jerky’.

The process for drying meat is —
e Construct a simple tripod frame to hold the meat strips.

e Cut the meat into thin strips and remove all fat and gristle as the fat will not dry and
will encourage the growth of bacteria. The thinner the strips the faster water will be
extracted. It is best to cut a small hole in one end of each strip of meat and pass a stick
through the hole rather than folding the strips over the stick as this provides an area on
the underside of the meat that will not dry and will harbour bacteria.

e Hang the strips in a sunny, breezy spot for 2-3 days to sun-dry it or place it alongside a
slow burning fire to smoke it until the meat goes hard to the touch and dark in colour.
When meat is smoked the smoke will solidify the protein content of the meat and stop
decomposition and seal in any flavour.

e When smoking meat do not let the fire produce flames and remember that the best way
to produce smoke is to use sawdust, wood chips or crushed bark as fuel for your fire.

e During the day you will need to keep flies, insects and scavengers such as birds,
goannas, dogs, cats and rodents away from the meat. It is a good point to remember
that any scavengers attracted to the drying or smoking meat may also be a source of
food to be trapped or killed.

e At night all the meat strips should be taken off the drying-frame and wrapped in
material to protect them from dew and moisture.
