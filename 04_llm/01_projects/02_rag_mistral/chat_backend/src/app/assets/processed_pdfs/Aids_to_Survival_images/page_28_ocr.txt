AIDS TO SURVIVAL

Building shelters

Your shelter will depend largely on what is available to use and what the conditions are.
Common sense will guide you but be warned, a shelter takes a good deal longer to build than
one imagines. If you can find something that will provide a part of a shelter such as a hollow
log, then use it as the basis of your shelter, this will save time and energy.

Some fairly simple types of shelter, which you can build, with a minimum of effort include
the following -

The A-frame shelter

The aboriginal shelter
