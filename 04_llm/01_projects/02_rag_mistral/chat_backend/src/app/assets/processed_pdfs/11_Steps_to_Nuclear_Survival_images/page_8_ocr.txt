Time

The radioactivity in fallout weakens rapidly in the first hours
after an explosion. This weakening is called “decay”. After seven
hours, fallout has lost about 90% of the strength it had one hour
after the explosion. After two days it has lost 99%; in two weeks
99.9% of its strength is gone. Nevertheless, if the radiation at the
beginning were high enough, the remaining 0.1% could be
dangerous.

Radiation must be measured by special instruments handled by
people trained to use them. But, if you stay in a shelter during the

RADIATION DECAY TIME

first days following an explosion, you escape the strongest radia-
tion. You should stay in the shelter until radiation has been meas-
ured and you have been told over the radio that it is safe to come
out.

Distance

The strength of radiation reaching your body is reduced the
farther you are from the fallout. Here are some illustrations of the
safest place to be when you are in various kinds of buildings.
