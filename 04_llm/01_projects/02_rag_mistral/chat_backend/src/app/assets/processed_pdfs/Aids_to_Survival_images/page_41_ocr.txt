AIDS TO SURVIVAL

EDIBLE PLANTS

A vast number of plants that can provide food in an emergency occur naturally in Western
Australia. However, many of them are hard to identify without expert help and many more
have sharp or tangy juices that discourage people who cautiously taste them. It is
recommended that when travelling around the state you should source information on edible
and poisonous plants from locals, resident experts and local authorities relevant to their area.

PLANTS TO AVOID

The seeds of many of the native pea and bean family are highly poisonous. It is best to avoid
these native plants even though garden varieties are good to eat. After all, if you are already
working hard at surviving, you do not want to add illness to your misfortunes.

You should also avoid the palm-like plants. Zamia palm fruits contain poisons and so do the
young shoots. Unless you are absolutely certain of the identity of the palms that you are about
to eat they are best left alone.

Fungi are another group of plants best avoided. Although many of the fungi that are found in
Western Australia can be eaten they provide little nourishment and there is no rule to
eliminate the deadly species.

THE TASTE TEST FOR PLANT EDIBILITY

Should you find vegetation that you think is edible you must carry out the taste test to reduce
the chance of eating something that will harm you.

Look

Does it look like something you can eat. Look for poison indicators such as prickles or milky
sap. Another indicator is any fruit that is divided into five divisions. Discussion with experts
will indicate peculiarities specific to particular regions.

Smell
Break open, crush it and smell it. Be wary of things that smell like almonds or peaches.

Touch
Rub on to a tender part of your body such as the inside of the wrists and wait approximately
20 minutes to see if a rash develops.

Taste
Rub on the inside of the lip and top of the tongue, testing for flavour and reaction. The plant
should be discarded as a food source if a sharp, stinging or burning sensation is present.

Eat

Eat a very small portion if all the above tests prove negative and wait for a few hours to see if
there are any reactions. If there is no reaction then you may eat a larger portion, continue to
do this until you are sure that even large quantities will not harm you.

Note:

Always carry out the taste test on anything that you cannot positively identify and
remember should the part you have tested prove to be inedible then do not discard it
as cooking may make it edible. If one part of a plant proves to be inedible then you
should be prepared to test the other parts [roots, leaves, etc].
