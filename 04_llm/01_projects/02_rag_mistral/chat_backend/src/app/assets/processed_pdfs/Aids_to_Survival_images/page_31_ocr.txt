AIDS TO SURVIVAL

The Fire - Bow Method

This method is used by many indigenous people around the world. To use the fire-bow take a
turn around the drill with the nylon cord attached to the bow [if you have used green timber
for a bow the tension will be applied automatically, otherwise use your fingers to hold it
tight]. Place the tip of the drill into the base starting groove and hold the headstock onto the
top of the drill. Push and pull the bow to rotate the drill. The over-heated shavings [punk] will
fall through the groove in the base onto the tinder. The small ember, which will form, should
be held in the tinder and blown until it ignites.

The fire-bow method of fire lighting

The Bow - can be any branch of a tree and should be approximately 45cm to 60cm.
The Head Stock - is a piece of hardwood to hold the top of the drill and allow it to rotate.

The Base - is a softer piece of dry wood flattened top and bottom so it will sit on the ground
to allow the drill to start. A small groove is cut into the side of the base directly beside where
the drill is to be used to allow the shavings or punk to fall onto the tinder.

The Drill - consists of a piece of dry wood of soft texture 30 - 40cm long and as straight as
possible. The diameter should be 1.5cm to 2cm, the drill sharpened to a point at both ends to
fit into the starting groove of both the base and head stock.

Note:

One of the better types of wood to use for both the drill and base is the lower wooden
portion of the flower stalk from the balga plant.

The Lens Method

Strong sunlight focused through a lens can produce enough heat to ignite tinder. The lens can
come from a magnifying glass [including the base of some compasses], binoculars, camera or
telescopic sights from firearms.

Flint, Steel and Magnesium Blocks

Flint is a stone which if struck with a piece of steel [knife] produces sparks, which will ignite
tinder. Magnesium blocks [flint attached] are available commercially for inclusion in survival
kits as emergency firelighters.
