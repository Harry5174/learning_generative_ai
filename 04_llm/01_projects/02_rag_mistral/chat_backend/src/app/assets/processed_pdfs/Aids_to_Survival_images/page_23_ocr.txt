AIDS TO SURVIVAL

Tree Roots

In the early morning before the heat of the day, the roots from trees such as the boab,
kurrajong, wattle and some gums can be cut into short lengths, stood end-on with their
thickest ends down in a container allowing the fluid to drain. It is best to use roots that are
easily obtained with a minimum of effort. The ideal location for this is in creek beds and
washouts where parts of the roots are already exposed or near the surface.

Draining water from tree roots

Certain Trees

Some trees such as the boab, desert-oak, she-oak and paperbark store water. Water will collect
in the crevices of some of these trees after rain, in blisters under the bark in others such as the
paperbark and in the sapwood under the bark of the boab.

It is preferable to use a length of rubber tubing to siphon water from crevices and to extract
the water from blisters and under bark by cutting a ‘V’ through the bark and collecting the
escaping water in a container.

Note:

Chewing the sapwood of trees is not recommended as it may aggravate thirst.

Coastal Water Sources
You can obtain drinking water by digging high up on the beach above the tidemark or behind
the first sand hills. It tastes brackish and should only be used in small quantities.

Dew
The collection is tedious, but of some value in heavy grassland. Tie clumps of grass or cloth
around ankles and walk around in dew-drenched grass at dusk or dawn. Squeeze moisture into
a container and repeat. If you have a vehicle, wipe down the vehicle with a cloth and collect
the dew in a container. You can also dig ‘dew holes’ and line them with plastic to collect the
dew.

Foliage Bags

If there are no large trees in the area you can break up clumps of grass or small bushes and
place them inside the bag, the same effect will take place as in transpiration. Make sure you
follow the guidelines and provide a sump and remember to replace the foliage at regular
intervals when water production is reduced.
