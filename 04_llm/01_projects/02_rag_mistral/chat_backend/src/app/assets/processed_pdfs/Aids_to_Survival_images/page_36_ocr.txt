AIDS TO SURVIVAL

Note:

Remember traps and snares are illegal in Western Australia and should only be used
in survival situations when your life is in danger.

Bird Life

Ground feeding birds can be trapped by placing grass or other bait under a cage made from
wire netting or green sticks woven together. The cage is propped up with a stick that is pulled
out by a hidden observer tugging a string as the bird walks under the cage. The cage falls,
trapping the bird.

The bird trap

A fishing line can also be used successfully. Bait the hook with an insect, bread, or other
edible matter; tie the line to a tree or stick where the birds frequent.

Birds are rather difficult to shoot or trap because of their flighty nature but you may be lucky
enough to locate a nest, either on the ground or in the trees, containing eggs or young.

Most birds try to confuse intruders by flying away from their nest at the approach of any
danger. This has the effect of leading the intruder in the wrong direction, thus protecting the
eggs or young.

Emus are very common in outback areas and can be enticed towards bright objects waved by
a person hiding behind a bush. As the bird's inquisitive nature leads it within metres of the
object, the person can then step out and kill the bird with a suitable weapon.

When shooting or trapping, frequent a water source if possible. Stealth, not speed, is of great
importance when shooting and patience at a water hole at dawn or dusk is usually rewarded.
