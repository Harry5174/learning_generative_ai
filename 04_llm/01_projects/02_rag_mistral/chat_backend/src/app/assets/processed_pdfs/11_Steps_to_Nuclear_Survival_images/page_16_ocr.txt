KNOW HOW TO PREVENT AND
FIGHT FIRES

Misinformation about the fire danger from nuclear explosions
is widespread and common. For example, some persons believe
that the fire-ball would completely incinerate a city, This is not true.

The heat from the fire-ball last about 15 seconds and would
create fires which are no different from the fires you see in
peacetime. They can be put out with water and extinguishers, and if
cach survivor were able to put out a small fire quickly, mass fires
would not take place.

The heat flash from the fire-ball entering through windows and
doors could set fire to curtains, clothes, furniture and paper. Other
fires could break out in attics, in backyard trash, on wooden
shingles and on the outside of houses built of wood particularly if
they are unpainted or weathered.

Knowing how to prevent and fight fires at home and at work
reduces the number of peacetime fires. The same knowledge will
ulso reduce the number of fires caused by a nuclear explosion.

But how can you fight fires in the presence of fallout? From
5 to 15 miles from the centre of the explosion, there will be many
survivors. Fallout will not start coming down for about 30 minutes.
During this half hour, survivors should inspect their houses and
put out all the small fires they can. They must not rely on the
fire department to extinguish these fires.

You should have in your home and place of work, fire extin-
guishers, or in an emergency, create a water supply for fire fighting
in pails, bathtubs, washtubs, etc. Don’t rely on being able to use
the established water supply system.

Even those who live in areas not attacked may find their fire
departments will have to fight major fires elsewhere. Every house-
holder should learn how to carry out fire prevention and know how
to fight small fires. It may prove of value in peacetime!

Your local fire authorities are always anxious to advise you on
how to fight fires. Attend any emergency fire fighting classes held
in your area,
