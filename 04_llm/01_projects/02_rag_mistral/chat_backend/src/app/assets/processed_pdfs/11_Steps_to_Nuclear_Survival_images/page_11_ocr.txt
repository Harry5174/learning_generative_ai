Before Attack

If sirens or warning systems signal impending attack, regardless
of where you are or what you are doing, you must take the best
available cover against the blast, heat and light effects of nuclear
explosions.

Emergency broadcast instructions will include the following
advice:

(1) If you are at home go to the basement or strongest part of
your house or building which offers the best protection. If
material is handy, improvise blast protection. See Step 4.

(2) Take your battery radio with you, or turn up the house
radio so that you can hear it while under cover.

(3) Stay away from windows.

(4) Lie down and protect yourself from flying glass and falling
debris.

(5) Shield your eyes from the flash of an explosion.

(6) If you are away from home take protective cover imme-
diately.

(7) If you are travelling, stop and take protective cover imme-
diately, or if you are only a few minutes from a safe destina-
tion, proceed and take protective cover immediately.

(8) Listen to your radio for further instructions.

the fallout and give instructions and advice. These might include:
