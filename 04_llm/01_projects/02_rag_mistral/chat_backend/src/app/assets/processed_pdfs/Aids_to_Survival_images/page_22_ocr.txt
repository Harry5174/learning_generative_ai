AIDS TO SURVIVAL

METHODS OF WATER PROCUREMENT

Your first efforts in a survival situation should be directed towards establishing a good water
supply. Initially you should look for ground water using the following methods.

Creek beds

Are easily discernible in dry areas because of the relatively green vegetation and taller trees
following the course of the creek. Unless there has been recent rain in the area the creek bed
will probably be quite dry. You may be lucky enough to locate damp sand or mud at the
bends of the creek or by digging in the creek bed at a likely spot. Water can be extracted from
the damp sand or mud by soaking a rag in soil and wringing out the water into a container.

Where to dig in creek beds for water

Rock Formations

If there is any water seepage from the ground, it is usually to be found near rock formations,
where the country is rugged and undulating. It may also be found in some apparently dry
areas. Rocky areas are ideal for rain catchments. Rain soaks very quickly into the soil,
whereas it can lie in pools on a rocky surface for some time.

Salt Lakes
After rain has fallen, the top 3mm of a salt lake is fresh water. It can be siphoned off by using
a grass straw or tubing from your survival kit.

Windmills

These have been erected on most farms and stations throughout the state at such locations as
wells, dams and soaks. These can be seen from a long distance and usually have animal tracks
leading to them. Check the water at these mills has not gone salty.

Animal Trails

Animals need water the same as humans and they will travel great distances regularly each
day, leaving trails to the water source. Where a large number of trails converge together, it
would indicate that the water was not far distant.

Water seepage
Sometimes water can be found close to the surface in natural springs and soaks or at the base
of cliffs and rock-piles where vegetation appears to be thriving.
