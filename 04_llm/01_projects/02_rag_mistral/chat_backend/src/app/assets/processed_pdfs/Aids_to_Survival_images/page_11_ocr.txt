AIDS TO SURVIVAL

VEHICLE AWARENESS

The development of electronic [computer] engine management systems for modern diesel
engines has forced a change in the way diesel 4WD owners operate their vehicles. The
reservations a lot of people had with the development of computer engine management
systems in petrol-powered 4WD vehicles in the early 90’s were in most cases largely
unfounded. What was required then and now with the modern diesel is driver education.

Gone are the days when all a diesel 4WD owner had to worry about with a water crossing was
keeping the air intake out of the water. In effect these new generation 4WD diesels, because
of the electronics, have to be treated like petrol-powered vehicles. Contact your local dealer or
AWD service centre and have them point out the location of the vulnerable points [electronic]
under the bonnet of the vehicle.

Remember a clean engine is less likely to short out. To prevent condensation [a problem for
any electrics] clean the engine bay when the engine is cold with low-pressure cold water.

Once these vulnerable or sensitive components are located suitable precautions can be taken.
The location of the main computer is usually under the seats or behind the front left or right
inside kick panels, near your feet.

A word of caution with these computer managed 4WD’s for those who traditionally fit their
own radios and other electrical accessories. Finding the nearest live wire or earth and
connecting to it is fraught with danger. If the pick-up wire is part of the computer
management hardware that carries signals and mixed voltages you could unknowingly cause
expensive irreparable damage.

Note:
To prevent damage have any electrical accessories fitted by a professional.

Jump-starting is no longer a matter of connecting any set of jumper leads between vehicles.
Your leads should have a surge protector fitted to prevent a possible voltage spike which will
damage most computers.

Most 4WD vehicles with computer management systems will have an emergency limp home
mode that comes into play when the engine management system has been adversely affected.
Although the extent of operation will vary from vehicle to vehicle road speed will be limited
and cruise control, traction control and other non-vital functions will be disabled. Visually, a
dashboard-warning icon will be displayed telling you which system has been disabled.

The benefits gained from computer engine management systems for diesels such as more
power, better fuel economy and lower fuel emissions should not be jeopardised by a driver’s
level of ability or lack of knowledge and understanding of the vehicles systems and
components. As a new owner you should take the time to study the owners manual and
consult with your dealer or 4WD service centre before you venture off road.
