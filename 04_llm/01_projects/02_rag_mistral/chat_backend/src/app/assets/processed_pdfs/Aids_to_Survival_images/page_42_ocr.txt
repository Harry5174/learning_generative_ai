SOME COMMON TYPES OF EDIBLE VEGETATION

Banksias [banksia sp]

Flowers contain large amounts of sweet nectar that can be sucked from the flower or stirred in
water to make a refreshing sweet drink. This should be done early in the morning when dew is
present.

Balga [xanthorrhoea sp]
Has an edible white substance at the base of the green leaves, this is quite sweet when eaten
raw. The plant is killed when you remove this growing heart.

Berry Saltbush [rhagodia baccata]
A spreading shrub that less than two metres high with short, grey-green leaves that grows near
the coast with small edible red berries that are very sweet when ripe.

Bloodroot Yams [haemodorum sp]
The roots are eaten raw or mildly roasted. They are sweet, juicy and hot, somewhat
resembling a very mild onion in flavour but with considerable bite.

Boab [adansonia gregorii]
The nuts should be collected when mature but before they harden, the seeds and pith can be
eaten raw or soaked in water, they have a taste like dried condensed milk.

Bracken Fern [pteridium sp]

This and some other large ferns are edible while the green shoot is in the "fiddle head" stage.
Although they can be eaten raw, they are more palatable when cooked, the underground stems
although stringy are rich in starch and roast up well in the campfire.

Bush Tomato [solanum diversiflorum]

These grey coloured shrubs grow to about 50cm and have prickles on the stem and leaves, the
flowers are purple. The fruit when ripe are pale yellow with black seeds surrounded by pulp.
The fruit is cooked in ashes, the seeds removed and the flesh eaten.

Bulrush [typha sp]

These plants generally grow along the edges of lakes, swamps and large dams. The horizontal
stems are rich in starch but need pounding to separate this from the strong fibres running
through the plant.

Christmas Tree [nuytsia floribunda]

The young roots are edible and are peeled and eaten they have a moist brittle centre that tastes
like sugar. The flowers can be soaked in water to make a sweet refreshing drink and the gum
can be eaten.

Desert Raisin [solanum centrale]
The fruit is initially purple-green and is eaten raw when green-white to yellow-brown. When
dried it has the taste and appearance of a dried sultana and can be stored.

Emu Plums [podocarpus drouynianus]
A low shrub found in the southern forests yields a dark purple, edible fruit of good flavour.
The attached green "seed" should be discarded.

Figs [ficus sp]
Fig trees of one kind or another are found across much of Australia's inland, their glossy,
green leaves are very distinctive and the red, pulpy fruits are excellent eating.

Geebungs [persoonia sp]

These shrubs or small trees are found mainly in the south of the state, the pith from the small
fruits are edible and tastiest when collected from beneath the tree, the skin and seeds should
be spat out. These are also known by the unappetising name "snotty-gobbles".
