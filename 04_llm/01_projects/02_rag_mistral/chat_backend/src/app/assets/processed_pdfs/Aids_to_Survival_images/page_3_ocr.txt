AIDS TO SURVIVAL

Introduction

This Western Australia Police Academy publication was initially written and compiled by
Sergeant Bert O’Meagher APM, Officer In Charge, Command & Land Operations Unit at the
Western Australia Police Academy in collaboration with First Class Constable Dennis Reid
and Dr Ross Harvey MBBS Dobst RCOG.

The Command & Land Operations Unit was introduced to provide members of the Western
Australia Police Service with the necessary skills and knowledge to carry out their duties in
outback Western Australia and to enable them to co-ordinate or participate in emergency
operations and advise on outback safety. In keeping with the WA Police Service mission to
provide a safer and more secure Western Australia the unit is concerned with the education of
interested community groups and individuals.

Originally the book was produced to provide members of the Western Australia Police
Service with a locally produced source of reference for use in training and for dissemination
to the public. To this end the book has proved to be extremely successful, this being the 22nd
edition with over 435,000 copies being distributed since its introduction in 1979.

The book is required reading for several community groups, youth organisations, education
institutions and industry trainers throughout Western Australia. It is now available on the
Internet under the WA Police Service website.

A dedicated group of community minded individuals and organisations have contributed
information and items over the years and their efforts and contributions are much appreciated.
Contributors include - Peter Bindon, Vern Delgado, Arthur Connor, Graham Brammer,
Ronele and Eric Gard, Richard Lushey, John Evans [CALM], The Duke of Edinburgh’s
Award [WA], The Royal Lifesaving Society [WA], St John Ambulance [WA], Red Cross
[WA], Bureau Of Meteorology [WA], Australian Communications Authority and Sergeant
Phil Ramsay [WA Police]. Diagrams were originally drawn by Western Australian
Government Print.

Staff at the Western Australia Police Academy Command & Land Operations Unit who have
contributed to the book include Senior Constable Paul McKee, Senior Constable Ian
Thomson, Senior Constable David Stark, Senior Constable Douglas Fleetwood and
Senior Constable Glen Blackwell.

Thanks are also extended to students of classes conducted by the Western Australia Police
Academy Command & Land Operations Unit and members of the community of Western
Australia who have provided valuable comment and feedback.
