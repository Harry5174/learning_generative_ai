steadied and supported to prevent movement of the broken ends
before attempting to move the patient.

If a person’s back or neck is so severely injured that he is afraid
to move because of pain, or cannot move or feel his limbs, you
should assume that he has a broken back. He should be moved on
a hard, firm stretcher taking great care not to “jack-knife” him by
picking up his feet and shoulders. Improvised stretchers can be
made from a door, wide board, window shutter, etc. Fill in the
natural hollows of the back and neck with padding and support the
head on both sides to prevent movement.

DO NOT:

Put strong antiseptics into a wound,

Use a tourniquet.

Remove clothing which is stuck to a burn.

Break any blisters or apply creams or grease to a large burn.

Give anything by mouth to a semi-conscious patient, or to a
patient with internal abdominal wounds.

HOME NURSING HINTS

Before medical or nursing help becomes available you may
also encounter infant care problems, emotional problems and
persons suffering from radiation sickness. What to observe, and
what to do for these latter cases, is outlined below.

Infant Care

Breast feeding is preferable but, if not possible, then a formula
using powdered or evaporated milk should be prepared under
clean conditions.

If vomiting or diarrhoea occurs infants and children become
dehydrated very quickly. To avoid this happening give frequent
sips of boiled water.

If a rash or fever develops, keep others away from the sick child.

Emotional Problems

Persons who become emotionally disturbed following a disaster
should be treated calmly but firmly. They should be kept in small
groups, preferably with persons whom they know and encouraged
to “talk out” their problem. If they are not otherwise injured
they should be given something to do. It may be necessary to
enlist the aid of one other calm person to help subdue the over-
excited patient. If a stunned or dazed reaction persists over 6 to 8
hours this should be reported to a doctor or nurse immediately
one becomes available.

Radiation Sickness

The signs and symptoms of this illness are described in Step 2,
page 15.

Treatment includes rest, the provision of whatever nutritional
food and drink is available and personal encouragement to get weil.
Swab the mouth gently with mild, warm salt and water if it becomes
sore. As these patients are susceptible to infection, keep wounds
clean and covered with a sterile dressing. Separate these patients
from persons with colds, rash or fever.
