AIDS TO SURVIVAL

Desert Kurrajongs [brachychiton sp]

Identified by their boat shaped pods filled with shiny, yellow seeds. Use a stick to remove the
seeds as the small hairs surrounding them are irritating to the skin. The seeds should be
winnowed by pouring between two containers to allow the wind to carry away the prickly
hairs then pounded and roasted with a little water to make porridge or roasted until black and
then crushed and used like ground coffee to provide a drink.

Native Banana [leichardtia australis]

Is a vine with greyish leaves, tiny flowers and white, milky sap. Even though milky saps
usually indicate that poisons are present, these immature, large, greenish, pear shaped fruit
can be eaten raw or cooked, once ripe only the yellow seeds are edible.

their fleshy leaves is a little salty it can be purified. When the petals drop off the flowers the
purple-red base is revealed and the juicy centre of seeds in a white pulp can be eaten.

Quandongs [santalum accuminatum]

purple fruit.

Ruby Saltbush [enchylaena tomentosa]
