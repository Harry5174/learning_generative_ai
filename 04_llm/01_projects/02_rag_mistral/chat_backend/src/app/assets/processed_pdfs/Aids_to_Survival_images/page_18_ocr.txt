SURVIVAL PLANS

The Survival Plan is the final process by which you or the group have chosen to stay alive. It
is the final result of your appreciation and should be based on the facts at hand that have been
subject to thorough and systematic thought and/or discussion. It needs to be prepared in a
systematic way and re-examined regularly. It must be accurate, brief but clear, contain all
necessary information and most importantly be capable of being carried out.
