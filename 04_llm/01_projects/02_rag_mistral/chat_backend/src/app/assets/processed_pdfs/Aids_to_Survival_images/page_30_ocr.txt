AIDS TO SURVIVAL

Warmth

In Western Australia in the period from 1983 to 1999, thirteen people died due to excessive
cold. Many of these deaths could have been prevented had the individuals possessed the
resources and skills to light a fire.

FIRELIGHTING WITHOUT MATCHES

Fire cooks, warms, sterilises and acts as a signal if necessary. To start a fire requires an
understanding of combustion. For combustion to occur requires the presence of fuel, heat and
oxygen. Fuel consists of dry vegetable matter, dry animal manure, reactive chemicals,
kindling and timber. Heat can be provided by friction, chemical reaction, spark or
magnification. Remember that oxygen is the essential ingredient to produce flame from heat
and fuel.

Always carry some form of fire starter with you on trips such as waterproof matches or
lighter. If you do not have these then your skills should include at least one of the following
methods. Remember that traditional methods of fire lighting require a high degree of patience
and skill and should be learned and practised in a training environment.

Vehicle Method

Your vehicle has probably been fitted with a cigarette lighter. Use this to ignite a petrol
soaked rag [outside the car]. If you do not have a lighter then remove the battery from the
vehicle, pull out two wires from the vehicle and attach these to the terminals of your battery
and run them away to the ground. When the ends are touched together they will spark and
ignite tinder.

The battery method of fire lighting

Note:

The gas produced by a battery is highly volatile and if exposed to a spark could cause
an explosion. Make sure the fire is started away from the battery.

Torch Battery Method

A fire can be started by holding very fine steel wool from your tool kit over the negative
terminals of a 6-volt torch battery and brushing it against the positive terminal. The sparks
produced should ignite the steel wool [make sure you have tinder ready].

Chemical Method

Condies Crystals [carried in some survival and/or first aid kits] can be used to start a fire by
mixing in equal amounts with sugar [barley sugar can be used] and grinding them with the flat
of a knife blade. The result is a brief intense flame.

Note:

Make sure that you have tinder prepared and ready when lighting fires.
