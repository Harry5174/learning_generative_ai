and have no froth on them, breathing is not obstructed.

If the patient is breathing noisily and with difficulty, if his lips are
blue and frothing, or if his chest is sucked inwards when he breathes
in, his airway is obstructed and needs immediate attention.

Keep the airway clear by:

Placing the casualty on his back; supporting his shoulders ‘on a
pad of any suitable material available; tilting the head back with one
hand on the forehead, the other lifting the neck,

GLOW INTO MOUTH.

HOLD THE JAW UP ANB
BACK WITH ONE HAND

PINCH THE NOSE.

THE MOUTH IS OPENED JUST WIDE ENOUGH SO
THAT AIR CAN BE BLOWN INTO IT.

If his breathing stops you can breathe for the patient by blowing
air into his lungs. Take a deep breath. Pinch the casualty’s nostrils.
Place mouth to mouth tightly. Blow into the casualty’s lungs
strongly enough to cause his chest to rise. The cycle should be
repeated every 3 to 5 seconds for an adult and a little more fre-
quently for a child. Blow more gently for a child or a baby, but
strongly enough to make the chest rise.

Wounds
You Must: Stop bleeding (haemorrhage)
Keep out gerins (infection).

Cover the wound with a clean dressing to keep out dirt and germs.
Bandage it on firmly to stop the bleeding. If a wound is bleeding
profusely, hold it firmly with your hand until you can secure an
emergency dressing. Any thick pad of clean, soft, compressible
material large enough to cover the wound will make a good dress-
ing. Clean handkerchiefs, towels, sanitary pads, tissue handker-
chiefs or sheets make good emergency dressings.

SKIN BLOOD ESCAPING PRESSURE

BLEEDING FROM FRESH WOUND BLEEDING CONTROLLED BY PRESSURE

Burns

Cover'the burned area with large, thick, dry dressing and bandage
it on firmly.

Encourage the casualty to drink plenty of fluids. A solution of
salt and soda is useful to give to casualties with burns and to those
who have suffered from serious bleeding.

Broken bones (fractures)

If a limb is very painful and cannot be used, appears to be bent
in the wrong place or the casualty says he heard or felt the bone
snap, it is likely that a bone is broken.

Sharp ends of a broken bone may damage important structures
such as blood vessels and nerves. A broken limb should be
