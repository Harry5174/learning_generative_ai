KNOW THE FACTS ABOUT
RADIOACTIVE FALLOUT

If a nuclear weapon is exploded on, or near, the ground, the
danger from radioactive fallout is greatest. The force of the ex-
plosion may make a crater up to a mile wide and to a depth of one
hundred feet. Millions of tons of pulverized earth, stones, buildings
and other materials are drawn up into the fireball and become radio-
active. Some of the heavier particles spill out around the point of
explosion. The rest are sucked up into the mushroom cloud.

This radioactive material is then carried by winds until it settles
to earth. This is called ‘‘Fallout”. Under some circumstances you
may see the fallout; under others you may not.

The radioactivity it gives off cannot be seen. You can’t feel it.
You can’t smell it.

But fallout doesn’t come out of the sky like a gas and seep into
everything. It can best be described as a fine to coarse sand carried
by the winds. Because the wind direction varies at different heights
above the ground, it is not possible to judge from the ground where
the fallout will settle. It can settle in irregular patterns hundreds of
miles from the explosion.

The fallout from a 5-megaton explosion could affect seriously an
area of 7,000 square miles. If nothing were done to gain protection
during the period of high radioactivity, there would be a grave
danger to life in that area,

Because fallout is carried so far and covers such a large area, it
could be the greatest danger to the largest number of Canadians in
a nuclear war. If Canada was not hit by nuclear bombs, those ex-
ploding in the United States close to our border could result in
serious fallout in many parts of Canada.

There are four things which determine the amount of radiation
reaching your body from fallout.

(1) The time that has passed since the explosion,

(2) The length of time you are exposed to fallout.

(3) The distance you are from the fallout.

(4) The shielding between you and the fallout.
