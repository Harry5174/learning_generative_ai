KNOW YOUR MUNICIPAL PLAN

It is important that your local municipality have a plan for a
war emergency. And it is just as important that you know that plan.

Over the past several years, provincial and municipal govern-
ments, with the assistance of federal authorities, have been steadily
developing plans for the protection of the population and the
continuity of essential government services in wartime. Most
municipalities in Canada have emergency plans to deal with both
peacetime disasters and a nuclear attack situation. These include
the details of how welfare, health, police, public utilities, fire and
other emergency services will operate.

Some larger communities have developed plans to assist in the
evacuation of those who would choose to leave before an attack
or who might have to be evacuated as survivors or casualties
following an attack. These plans include traffic arrangements to
reception centres and medical facilities in nearby communities.

It would be unwise to try and prepare your own family survival
plan without first checking to see how it fits in with municipal plans.
This would be true whether you plan to go to a safer area before
attack or remain at home. It is particularly important that you know
and understand the arrangements to instruct the public about
staying in shelter and coming out of shelter when it is safe.
Fallout is a health hazard which will require countermeasures for
personal and family protection including assessment of radiation
and advice and instructions to those in shelter.

There must be close understanding and cooperation between the
public and municipal authorities responsible for their protection.

Find out about your municipal emergency plans now and keep
well informed about them as they are further developed.

HAVE A PLAN FOR YOUR FAMILY
AND YOURSELF

If you know what is contained in the first nine steps, and you
know your municipal plan for a war emergency, you should now
make your personal and family survival plan. The success of your
plan will depend on how many of the suggested recommendations
you carry out. Your chances of survival increase as you carry out
each recommendation.

Thinking about the problems with which you would be faced
should nuclear attack be launched against North America is the first
important step. Blast, light, heat and radioactive fallout are the
problems. A workable survival plan will include all of the prepa-
rations you can make in advance to meet those problems.
