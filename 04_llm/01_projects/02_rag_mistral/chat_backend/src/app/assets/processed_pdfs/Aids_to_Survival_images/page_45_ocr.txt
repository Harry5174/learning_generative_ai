HAND SPAN METHOD

The sun crosses the imaginary north/south line [meridian] every day at noon and there are 24
hours between crossings of the meridian. During this time the earth revolves through 360°. It
can therefore be said the sun travels from east to west at a speed of 15° per hour. To find
north simply note the time and plot the sun from its present position backward or forward as
the case may be to its noon position. The diagram below will give you a general indication of
measuring degrees using your hand span. You can experiment with this method and increase
accuracy by measuring sun movement with your hand and then measuring it with a compass
for comparison.

THE SHADOW STICK
To use the shadow stick method -
1. Pusha stick vertically into the ground
2. Place a stone at the end of the shadow
3. After a wait of 20 minutes place another stone at the end of the shadow
4. A line drawn from the first stone through the second stone will be a west-east line
5

Stand facing the stick with your left foot between the stones and your right foot past
the stones on the line drawn and you will be looking north.

Note:

In midsummer in areas north of the Tropic of Capricorn the shadow stick will be
behind you.
