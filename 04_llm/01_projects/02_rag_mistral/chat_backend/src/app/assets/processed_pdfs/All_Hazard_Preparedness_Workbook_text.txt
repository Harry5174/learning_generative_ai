This workbook was originally developed as an earthquake preparedness publication by
the Greater Victoria Emergency Coordinator’s Committee. Because British Columbia is aprovince of many hazards the workbook has been updated as an all-inclusive guide tofamily emergency planning.  The workbook now covers additional hazards such asfloods, forest fires, landslides, severe storms, and tsunamis.
This workbook, and other materials that provide information about individual and
neighbourhood safety, has been developed in co-operation, and with the support of,various agencies, groups and individuals such as: the Greater Victoria EmergencyPreparedness Committee, Thrifty Foods, Coast Capital Credit Union, Honda City, TTCDesign Group Inc., BC Transit, BC Gas, BC Hydro, Telus, BC Housing, the CreditAssociation of Victoria, Roger’s Cable, First Aid & Survival Technologies (FAST), JJMGroup, Puget Sound Power and Light Company, the Strengthening Preparedness AmongNeighbors (SPAN) Program, the Justice Institute of B.C., individuals and first responders.
The Justice Institute of B.C. also produces a companion guide, the Neighbourhood
Emergency Preparedness: Program Guide, to help communities create and sustainneighbour helping neighbour programs. 
INTRODUCTION
The diverse climate and land base of our province affords a variety of potential disasters.In an emergency, telephone, gas, electricity and water services may be disrupted for days.Roads could be blocked and stores and gas stations closed.  Being aware of the dangersand the best ways in which to lessen their impact is the core of emergencypreparedness. 
This workbook provides information and useful guidelines to help you protect your family
and property. When a disaster strikes, there won’t be time to find flashlight batteries orreplace missing first aid supplies; the time to prepare, is NOW!
HAZARDS IN BRITISH COLUMBIA
It is important to know the dangers that exist in your community and to design yourFamily Emergency Plan with those hazards in mind.  Earthquakes, tsunamis, floods,landslides, avalanches, interface fires, severe storms and hazardous material spills aresome of the dangers that could threaten lives and cause extensive damage in ourprovince.1All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 1 - Preparing Your Family for a DisasterSection 1
PREPARING YOUR 
FAMILY FOR A DISASTER
Make safety a natural part of your lifestyle. When a crisis occurs, you’ll be thankful for
that list of emergency numbers on your fridge, for knowing your family’s daily scheduleand for having an emergency kit ready to use. 
Although we can’t prevent natural disasters from happening, we can prepare to avoid
injury, minimize damage and come through the clean-up period as quickly andcomfortably as possible.
GUIDE TO FAMILY SAFETY
TContact your local authority to find out if there is a Neighbourhood Emergency
Program or Block Watch Program to assist residents in preparing for a disaster.
TCheck with local authorities to find out what hazards could occur in your area and
the impact they could have. 
TDevelop a Family Emergency Plan that addresses these issues and suits your family’s
individual needs and limitations.
TSketch the floor plan of your home showing the two main exit routes and an
alternate second exit from each room if possible.
TKeep your Family Emergency Plan in a visible place, such as the front of your
refrigerator.  Share your plan with your neighbours. Be sure to go through the steps
with anyone who stays in your home.
TMark on your plan the date it was prepared and update any changes in your
household when they occur.
TAssign specific safety tasks to family members (e.g. one person responsible for
gathering pets, one person responsible for first aid, etc.).
TPractice your Family Emergency Plan until everyone is sure of their role and keep it
current by practicing every six months.  Rehearsing can be fun, quality time with
your family.Emergency Preparedness WorkbookALL-HAZARD2All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 1 - Preparing Your Family for a DisasterTFor earthquake safety, you can go through your home with the Home Hazard Hunt
checklist and take measures that make your home safer.
TPrepare an Emergency Supply Kit to keep your family self sufficient for a minimum of
72 hours.  Be sure to include any special needs items you may require.
TAlso have Emergency Supply Kits in your vehicles and at your workplace.
TMark the areas where any special medical equipment, the Emergency Supply Kit and
the fire extinguishers are kept.
TYour family may not be together at home when an emergency occurs.  So plan a
family meeting place that’s central to most of your regular away-from-home spots.
TIn some emergency situations, local phone service may be limited. Plan to have an
out-of-area telephone contact where all family members can check in, in case you are
separated.
TCheck your insurance policies to ensure you have all the coverage you need for fires,
earthquakes, flooding, etc.
TKnowing how to use a ham radio can be a valuable asset in a crisis.  Consider
taking a course, especially if you live in an isolated area.
TTake first aid classes and keep your training current.
TKeep your vehicle in good repair and keep your gas tank at least half full.
TStay in touch with the world around you.  This will keep you informed of any
impending dangers to your community, such as a possible flood.  When warnings
occur, do a quick run through of the Family Emergency Plan and stay tuned to theradio or TV.3All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 1 - Preparing Your Family for a DisasterTIPS FOR THE ELDERLY and/or DISABLED
The information given in this workbook applies to everyone, but additional precautions
should be taken for those who are elderly and/or disabled.  Family Emergency Plansshould always include any special needs considerations:
TIf you live alone, get to know your neighbours and choose (if possible) two people
you trust to be your helpers during an emergency.  Explain your special needs, and
share your Emergency Plan with them, show them how to operate any medicalequipment you use, and practice your emergency procedures. 
TAdapt home safety measures to suit your needs.  For example, safety clips on
cupboards may not be appropriate for your particular disability; experiment with other
options, such as elastics joining drawer knobs together.
TKeep extra emergency supplies at your bedside or by your wheelchair if you have
mobility problems.  
TKeep your walking aids near you at all times, and, if possible, an extra cane or
walking aid in different rooms at home and at work. If you have a seeing eye dog,
keep a cane handy as well, as your dog may be injured or too frightened to help youduring a major disaster like an earthquake.
TIn your Emergency Supply Kit, remember to include extra prescription medications
and any medical equipment you use, such as catheters or inner tubes for your
wheelchair. 
TKeep a whistle and small flashlight near you as this will
help others find you in an emergency situation. The
international signal for help is three short blasts.
4All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 1 - Preparing Your Family for a DisasterLESSENING YOUR CHILDREN’S FEARS
Your children’s recovery time will be reduced if they understand the dangers of a
hazardous situation and are practiced and comfortable with their role in the FamilyEmergency Plan. 
PREPARE IN ADVANCE
Talk with your children about what to expect during and after a disaster. For example usethe resources of your local library for books and videos on earthquakes or floods. Thegoal is to create awareness, not to frighten them.
TEmphasize that they are learning to be safe when you practice the Family Emergency
Plan together and allow them to react.  
TBe sure they are adept at finding the safe place in each room and identify the safeplaces in their outside play areas.
TAsk your children’s school about their disaster response plans.  If the school holdsthe children until a parent picks them up, explain this to your children so they’ll
know this in advance.  
TChoose a friend or relative close to the school who will care for your children if
you’re unable to leave your location when the disaster strikes. Make sure that your
children and the school know who this is.
CARING FOR YOUR PETS IN AN EMERGENCY
Your pets won’t be able to fend for themselves in the event of an emergency and it isyour responsibility to protect and care for them.  Be sure your pet has a current I.D. tag,licence or identifying tattoo. When possible, keep your pet with you and remember thatyour pet will be frightened and confused.  If it is necessary to evacuate your house, beaware that pets are not allowed in most emergency shelters. If you must leave your pet
in the house, confine your animal to one room with plenty of water and dry food.5All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 2 - The Family Emergency PlanSection 2
THE FAMILY EMERGENCY PLAN
Preparedness is not a one-time activity but a continuous process; keep your family’s plan
in mind whenever you rearrange your house, change the building structure or familymembers leave home or move in.
REUNITING YOUR FAMILY
The home of a nearby friend, a local school or church are possible reunion locations.  Ifseparated in a crisis, having a prearranged site will decrease both time and stressinvolved in bringing your family back together.  Be sure to leave a note in a visible area ifyou decide to leave your home for this site!
Reunion Site:  #1Reunion Site:  #2During an emergency, long distance phone service is often easier to obtain than local
service. Choose someone who lives at least 160 kilometres (100 miles) away who hasvoice-mail or an answering machine as your out-of-area contact. 
Out-of-Area Contact:Area Code & Phone Number:Keep this information on a small card in your Emergency Supply Kit and in each family
member’s purse, wallet or backpack. 
When a disaster strikes, if family members are separated, each person should call the
out-of-area contact person, tell this person where they are and how they are doing andarrange a future check-in time.  As everyone checksin, the stress of worrying about your loved ones willbe reduced and it will also prevent needless searchingfor those already safe.
Emergency Preparedness WorkbookALL-HAZARD6All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 2 - The Family Emergency PlanEMERGENCY EVACUATION
In the event of a major disaster or threat to your home, you’ll need to be prepared to
evacuate quickly and efficiently.  Sketch the floor plan of your home and establish twoexit routes.  Be sure everyone knows how to leave safely out of an upstairs window ifyour home is multi-level. By planning and practicing what to do before a disaster strikesyou’ll have prepared your family to react in a safer manner at the first sign of danger. 
People with respiratory problems or who are pregnant should be removed from smoke or
fumes quickly.
List the most important items to be taken with you and only those that can be hand
carried.If your home is severely damaged or if there is an order to evacuate because of flooding,
interface fires, etc., here are some things you should do:
TVacate your home when advised to do so by local emergency authorities.  Ignoring
this warning could jeopardize not only the lives of your family members but also
those who try to rescue you.
TEnsure that each member of your family has warm clothing and waterproof footwear
and outerwear.
TEnsure that each family member has identification, especially your children.  Nametags on their clothing, wallet cards and wristband are useful in case you are
separated from them.
TIf a different meeting place than agreed on in your Emergency Plan is necessary,
make sure every member of your household knows where the new location is.
Provide your younger children with a note sealed in plastic stating the family’sdestination.
TMake arrangements for your pets.
TTurn off and unplug all appliances, lock doors and windows and (if you’ve been
instructed to do so) turn off all utilities at the main switches or valves. 
TTake your Emergency Supply Kit and any important papers/documents with you.
TLeave a note in your mailbox saying where you’ve gone.
TListen to emergency personnel and follow their directions. Follow specified routes.Don’t take shortcuts as you may end up in a blocked or dangerous area.
TRegister with the local emergency reception centre when you leave home, even if youare not staying at the centre; emergency responders need to know how to reach you
to advise when it is safe to return.7All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 2 - The Family Emergency PlanEVACUATION OF SENIORS and/or DISABLED
Special consideration needs to be given to those with special needs. 
Most visually impaired persons are familiar with the immediate area they are in.  In an
emergency situation, tell the person the nature of the emergency and guide themthrough any dangerous areas. Don’t leave them alone until they are in a safeenvironment.
As a person with a hearing impairment may not have heard any emergency warnings,
write out what is happening and tell them the evacuation procedure, such as: “There isa fire. Follow me to the rear door.” 8All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 3 - Important Family and Individual InformationSection 3
IMPORTANT FAMILY
AND INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION
When disaster strikes, you may need to access important contact numbers, health
information and household documents. Keep copies in two secure locations. A safetydeposit box, a fireproof safe or watertight bags in the freezer work very well. Storeditems should include deeds, wills, tax records, birth certificates, health records andphotographs or videotapes of valuables for documentation for insurance claims.

Section 4 - Emergency Supply KitsSection 4
EMERGENCY SUPPLY KITS
A properly prepared and maintained Emergency Supply Kit can be the key to bringing
you and your family through a major disaster. The kit should contain everything
your family may need to be self sufficient for at least 72 hours .  Plan your kit
carefully; every family is unique and has personal preferences, allergies and needs torecognize.
Emergency supplies can be acquired as ready-made kits or assembled item by item, as
they are listed in this workbook.  You can lessen the initial cost by purchasing anymissing supplies over several paydays. 
Store your Emergency Supply Kit in a cool shaded place away from chemicals and not
directly on a concrete floor.  A plastic or metal container with a tight fitting lid willprotect contents from odours, moisture damage and rodents.  If you choose to use aduffel bag or backpack, wrap a large garbage bag around it for extra protection.
Keep your kit accessible.  Possible locations are a closet near an exit or in your camper
or an outside shed. 
You may want to consider storing supplies in individual packs within your big container
so kit supplies are easier to move when evacuating.
Go through your kit every six months . Spring and fall are a good choice as you can
rotate your seasonal supplies to suit the oncoming weather conditions. Ensure all
batteries are working and replace water supplies and any items with a shelf life. Whenthe update is complete, mark the next date on a prominently placed calendar. 
HOME EMERGENCY KIT
FOOD SUPPLIES
When assembling your emergency food supplies, choose foods that:
• don’t require refrigeration • will not increase thirst
• need little or no preparation          • require little or no water
• are familiar to your family Emergency Preparedness WorkbookALL-HAZARD14All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 4 - Emergency Supply KitsDon’t forget to include any special dietary needs and a few treats, such as your family’s
favourite cookies or chocolate bars.
Check your local sporting goods and army surplus stores for pre-packaged kits.  Keep the
volume small and light and easy to carry in case an evacuation is necessary.  Chooseitems such as: peanut butter, canned fruits, vegetables and stews, canned fish and meat,pasta, beans and beef jerky.  High nutrient food bars, nutritional drinks and dried nutsand fruit are also good.  Seal all foods to prevent contamination by rodents, insects,humidity, ground water and drastic variations in temperature.
A three-day supply is the minimum amount of food for your Emergency Supply Kit but,
as a major disaster can disrupt your ability to purchase food, it is wise to maintain a
two-week supply in your everyday household provisions.
Camp stoves, sterno stoves, barbecues and hibachis can be
used as alternate cooking sources but do not use these
inside your home ! This could cause carbon monoxide
poisoning or a fire if there is an undetected gas leak.  Afondue pot or fireplace are other possibilities. If using thefireplace, be sure to inspect the chimney, mortar and flue forcracks before use.
Infant Needs
Based on your infant’s special diet and requirements, you should be prepared for asurvival period of three to five days.  Check with a pediatrician or family doctor to becertain your pack contains the proper supply of nourishment.

If using china or plastic dishes, limit dishwashing by lining dinnerware with plastic food
wrap to throw away after each use.  You can also label separate drinking cups for eachfamily member to use throughout the day.
WATER PROVISIONS
Water is the most important item to store. You will need at least four litres (1 gal.) of water per person per day (approximately two for drinking, two for foodpreparation and hygiene). Reduced intake of water can adversely affect your health andability to survive. A family of four will need 48 litres of water to have a three-day supplyon hand.
• Purchase bottled water if possible.• If creating your own water supply, store water in sturdy, opaque plastic jugs. Avoid
using plastic milk containers as the material becomes brittle over time and may crack.
• Clean the inside of the jugs thoroughly.  Fill half the jug with water and add chlorine
bleach in the amount listed below for purifying water.  Finish filling the container toits top with water.  Spread melted candle wax around the top of the rim and screwthe lid on tightly to create an air tight seal. Date the bottle and label it “purifieddrinking water.”
Store these containers in cool, dark locations.  Avoid storing water in areas where toxins
(such as gasoline and pesticides) are present as the vapours will penetrate the plasticover time. Do not store any plastic water container directly on con-crete.  The concretewill leach chemicals into the water causing contamination and it will also degrade thecontainer itself.
16All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 4 - Emergency Supply KitsAdditional Sources of Water
Hot water heater: It is easier to drain water from the heater if a hot water faucet is
turned on somewhere in the house. You must shut off the gas or electricity beforeemptying the heater and turn it on only after the water heater has been totally refilled.
Flush tank of the toilet: Purify this water before using it.  However, if you use any
commercial cleaning treatments in your tank, do not use this water for drinking.
Existing water in the plumbing: After shutting off the main water valve, open a
faucet on the top floor and catch the water as it drains from an open faucet on thelowest level.
Do not use water from your jacuzzi, swimming pool or waterbed except for hygienic
purposes.  Chemicals in the water make it unsafe to drink.  
Pipes that bring water into your home can be easily broken or cracked which might allow
the water to become polluted.  It is better to use your alternate water supply or to usethe following purifying instructions:
Purification Techniques
Wash containers with soapy water then fill with a 10 per cent bleach solution. After fiveminutes, empty the container and let air dry. (The same bleach solution can be used tosterilize all the containers you are using.) Strain any sediment or particles from the wateryou are purifying by pouring it through several layers of paper towels, cheesecloth orcoffee filters, then use one of the following purification methods: 
• Boil the water for seven to 10 minutes.• Add liquid household bleach* as follows:
Water If Water is Clear If Water is Cloudy
1 litre (1 qt.) 2 drops bleach 4 drops bleach
4 litres (1 gal.) 8 drops bleach 16 drops bleach
20 litres  (21 qt.) 2.5 ml (1/2teaspoon) bleach 5 ml (1 teaspoon) bleach
Directions: Shake the container of bleach and water to mix thoroughly then let water mixture stand
for 30 minutes before using. There should be a faint chlorine scent after treating. If there isn’t, add
the same amount of bleach again and let it stand for another 15 minutes.
*Note: Use only household liquid bleach that contains 5.25 per cent sodium hypochlorite.  
Do not use scented bleaches, coloursafe bleaches or bleaches with added cleaners.  
Do not use granular forms of bleach; they are poisonous. 
Water purification tablets (available at drug stores) can also be used. Follow all package

First aid supplies can be purchased in ready-made units or you can assemble one yourself
with fresh supplies.  Store supplies in a small container with a handle, such as acosmetic case or tackle box; this makes them easier to carry.  Tape a list of contentsinside the lid. Don’t forget to check the expiration dates. 
When purchasing prescription medications, ask your pharmacist about the storage
requirements and the length of time that your meds can safely be stored.  If possible,purchase an extra amount (two-week supply) for your First Aid Kit and rotate the supplywhenever you refill the prescription.

Clothing
Plan your clothing to suit all the seasonal weather conditions that occur in your area. In
extremely cold conditions, warmth is found in wearing multiple layers of clothing toreduce or restrict body heat loss. For summer, you’ll need protection against the sun.
Your body’s greatest heat loss occurs around your head and neck; include hats and
scarves for winter as well as sun hats and glasses for summer. Shoes and boots shouldbe warm, strong and waterproof.  Include heavy wool socks, good quality rain gear andheavy work gloves or mitts with liners. Coats and jackets should also match the weatherconditions. 
Lighting
Store two or three alternate sources of lights.  Caution: make sure there are no gas leaks
before using any open flame, including matches, candles and lanterns.  Remember thatin an earthquake situation, aftershocks may cause these to topple, which could start afire, so locate them with care.
TFlashlights, extra batteries and spare bulbs – batteries stored in the refrigerator last
longer.  Keep a small flashlight in your car, purse and briefcase.  No matter where
you live, you will have a source of light.19All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook

SANITATION
In a disaster situation, the usual methods of removing garbage, refuse and human waste
may be unavailable.  Improper disposal of these wastes however, can lead to secondaryproblems such as the spread of disease.  Use these guidelines to help protect your familyand community.
DISPOSING OF HUMAN WASTES
Solid wastes (feces) create a health problem that must be dealt with carefully.  Thefollowing are recommended ways to approach this:
• If damage exists only in the water lines you can still use the toilet. Turn off the main
water valve and use water from a swimming pool, jacuzzi or other available source(don’t waste drinking water).  Pour water directly into the bowl; this will flush thewaste down.
• If damage is suspected in the sewer lines however, do not flush the toilets.  Remove
the water from the toilet bowl and line it with two sturdy plastic bags.  Fold thebags down over the sides and put absorbent material such as kitty litter or shreddednewspaper into the inner bag. Defecate directly into the inner bag. Use toilet papersparingly and put used tissues into the same bag.  Sprinkle disinfectant directly ontothe feces. (Do not use dry bleach as it is caustic; powdered hydrated lime isrecommended and it can be purchased at hardware, home and garden centres).Replace the cover and wash your hands.
• Use a separate bucket for containing urine; a bucket that can be tightly covered,
putting used toilet paper into the emergency toilet.
• Always keep the lid down on the toilet when not in use.A sturdy bucket with tight fitting lid, small trash can or portable toilet will serve as an
alternative to your toilet. Line containers with a durable plastic bag and follow the aboveinstructions. Be sure to keep used waste bags in a container well away from humanactivity and labeled “Human Waste” and follow instructions from emergency personnelfor disposal. The urine bucket can be emptied in an area that is not near a well, springor other water supply, nor subject to flooding.  It should be poured into a hole 45-60centimetres (18-24 inches) deep and the hole should be filled in afterwards with dirt. Emergency Preparedness WorkbookALL-HAZARD23All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 5 - SanitationHANDLING GARBAGE
Odour, insects and vermin are problems that occur when garbage cannot be disposed of.
Be sure to strain any left over liquids and bury the residue in the same way as urine.After straining, wrap solids in layers of newspaper and store in plastic garbage bags in alarge garbage can with a tight-fitting lid.  Keep in an area away from human activity andkeep your pets and other animals from getting into the container.
Important Note:
Wash your hands with soap and water after handling human waste and garbage.24All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook

HAZARDS/EMERGENCY
PREPAREDNESS 
EARTHQUAKES
The danger of an earthquake is a concern to many British Columbians. Every year British
Columbia is subject to over 800 earthquakes – 200 of which occur on Vancouver Islandand the Lower Mainland. With over 70 per cent of our population living in thesouthwest corner of the province, that concern is well founded.  If we take the time toprepare ourselves, though, the possibility of injury and property damage will beconsiderably reduced.
It might help to first look at what an earthquake is and what to expect when it occurs:The earth’s surface is made up of huge plates of rock that gradually move over, under
and past each other. Over time, accumulated stress causes the rock to suddenly break orslip along a fault. This sudden movement and release of energy causes the ground toshake, pitch, and roll as seismic waves move through the earth.  
As you might expect, this sudden, rapid shaking can collapse buildings, bridges, tunnels;
disrupt utility services (phone, water, sewer, gas); and trigger landslides, fires, andfloods.  As frightening as this sounds, it has been proven that when a community isprepared, the impact of an earthquake can be drastically reduced. 
BEFORE AN EARTHQUAKE
TIdentify safe places in each room of your house
TIdentify the danger zones, such as by windows, swinging doors, tall or hanging
objects, chimneys or near gas appliances
TPractice your Family Emergency Plan 
TConsider purchasing earthquake insurance to defray costs of any damage
TUse the Home Hazard Hunt checklist to help prepare your home ( see next page )
TReview earthquake procedures at your workplace 
TDiscuss the earthquake plan at your children’s school  Emergency Preparedness WorkbookALL-HAZARD25All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 6 – Hazards/Emergency PreparednessHOME HAZARD HUNT
Preparing your home for dangerous situations such as earthquakes is well worth your
time and financial investment and could prevent injury to your family.  This doesn’t haveto be a restrictive process; be creative.  For example, if you’re in an earthquake zone andneed to remove heavy pictures from above your bed or couch, replace them with “softart,” such as tapestries.
The ground movement that accompanies earthquakes is seldom the cause of property
damage.  Homes that are structurally sound with their internal contents properly secured,generally come through earthquakes with relatively little damage.  On the other hand,unprepared homes are unsafe and their contents will be vulnerable to the shaking motionof an earthquake.
Using this list as your guide, walk through your home and identify the hazards that exist
in each room.  Address each hazard by following the instructions listed on the pagesassociated with them.  Check off the item as you complete making any necessarychanges.  
A quick rule of thumb:  “If it’s taller than it is wide, secure it!”
TStart with your water heater .  There should be very little space between the water
heater tank and the wall.  If there is more than 30–50 millimetres (one to two in.), attach awooden block (for example, 2 x4) to the wall studs with longscrews.  The goal is to create asnug fit between the tank andthe wall studs with longscrews. Wrap heavy-gaugemetal bands or nylon strapping1½ times around the tank andfasten to the wooden blockbetween the wall and the waterheater.
TSecure any gas appliances such
as your stove or clothes dryer
to a wall stud. If these objectsmove or topple, the resulting gas leak could destroy your home. Use flexible gaslines (where the gas code permits) to allow for a small amount of movement. 
TSecure refrigerators, top and bottom, with plumbers tape (perforated metal
strapping).  Screw one end into a wall stud and fasten the other securely to a
structural component of the refrigerator but NOT the coils.  Coils are made oflightweight material and will not support the weight of the unit.
Figure A26All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 6 – Hazards/Emergency PreparednessTWood burning stoves are usually freestanding so they are unsupported and
vulnerable to sliding or overturning.  Check with the manufacturer about bolting your
particular model to the floor.
TIf you must use castors or glides on appliances, lock the wheels or place a wedge
under the front wheels to keep them from
sliding or overturning. 
TTop heavy and free-standing furniture such as
tall bookcases, china cabinets, high chests of
drawers and shelving units should be secured.Use braided metal cable, chain or anglebrackets such as those in the diagram, tosecure them to the wall anchor. Always screwwall anchors into a stud and don’t use nails asthey can pull out during a large earthquake.Reposition your beds so tall furniture won’t falldirectly on you.
Identify rooms and items that need securing as
shown in Figure B:

TMirrors and heavily-framed pictures . If they are above a bed or couch, or beside
an exit, move them to another place. As shown in Figure D on next page, one way
to mount framed pictures and mirrors securely is to use long-shanked, open eye-hooks instead of traditional picture hangers. The eye-hooks must be long enough topenetrate the wall stud as well as the drywall or plaster. Eye-hooks used in this way
Figure C28All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 6 – Hazards/Emergency Preparednessare much less likely to pull out of the wall
than picture hooks installed with nails thatpenetrate only the drywall or plaster. Also,an alternative to running wire across theback of the picture or mirror is to useclosed eye-hooks securely screwed into theback of the frame.

TPost and Beams need to be inspected.  For a
building to stay together in an earthquake, all its
parts must be fastened together. Metal connectorsare used to strengthen places where the posts andbeams of the walls and the floor and the ceilingjoin. To strengthen the connections betweenceilings, walls and floors follow the directions in thediagram:
Don’t forget to also examine all exposed framing in
garages, basements, porches and patio covers.
TInspect your chimney and roof for loose bricks
and tiles that may be jarred loose in an earthquake. Determine whether plywood
should be added to the attic to protect your home in case your chimney falls. Theprovincial code requires that the clearance between interior chimneys and framingshould be at least 50 millimetres (2 in.) or 12millimetres (1/2 in.) for exterior chimneys.Reinforce the ceiling surrounding the chimneywith two centimetre (¾ in.) plywood nailedto the beams.  This will provide protectionfrom falling bricks that might break throughthe roof.

TWhen it comes to the water supply locate the
shut off valve for the water main that enters the house. It may like this.
Valves that have not been turned may be rusted open or they may 
only partially close. Replace valve, if necessary. Label this valve witha large tag and make sure all family members know where it is located.
TNatural gas leaks and explosions are responsible for a significant number of
fires following any major earthquake. It is vital that you and all family
members know where the gas meter is located and that everyone knows theproper procedures for turning it off.
Only shut off the gas at the meter if you smell the characteristic warning
odour of gas and/or you notice a large consumption of gas being registeredon the gas meter.  Until you are sure no gas leaks exist, do not usematches, lighters, open flame, appliances or operate any electricalswitches.
If you smell natural gas, immediately get everyone out of and away from the house.
Open the windows and doors to provide ventilation.  
Locate the gas meter and the shut-off valve on the
inlet pipe, see the illustration.  Make sure the valvewill turn.  It only takes a ¼ turn in either directionto shut gas main picture it off.  Valves that havenot been turned in a number of years may noteasily move.  Moving it about 1/8 of a turn is allthat is needed to assure you that it can turn.

Section 6 – Hazards/Emergency PreparednessDURING AN EARTHQUAKE
In an earthquake, sound usually precedes any ground movement by a split second.  This
is followed by shaking that can last from several seconds to several minutes. Over thefollowing hours or days, aftershocks may occur.
In Your Home, Workplace or Other Building
Do not run for the exits and outdoors. Stay inside during the quake. Duck, cover and
hold. Take cover beneath sturdy furniture or at an inside supporting wall or archway.
Stay away from glass windows and heavy mirrors. Wait for 60 seconds after the shakinghas stopped before you move from your position. Don’t ignite candles, matches orlighters. Remain clear of falling debris.
The following are a few examples of how to adapt the above to suit your location:
In a High-Rise Building
Duck, cover and hold as in any other building. Wait for 60 seconds after the shaking has
stopped before you move. Do not rush for the exits and do not use the elevator if youare leaving the building. Do not panic. 
In Shopping Malls and Other Public Places 
Try to take cover where you won’t be trampled, avoiding windows, skylights and displayshelves with heavy objects. Do not run for the exits or use the elevator. Seek assistancefrom staff to evacuate the building. 
Outdoors
Take cover under anything sturdy such as a picnic table or bus bench and hold on untilthe shaking stops. Stay clear of tall buildings, brick walls, street lamps, overhead signs,hydro lines or other objects that may fall on you.  If possible, duck into a doorway toavoid falling bricks, glass and other debris. If you’re at the bottom of a hill, watch forlandslides or falling boulders.
Never assume downed power lines are dead.  People, metal and damp objects
are conductors.  Stay back to avoid electric shock.
In a Vehicle
Stay in the vehicle with your seatbelt fastened, until all shaking stops.  The vehicle’shard-topped roof can protect you from falling debris. If a power line falls on the car, DONOT get out, unless absolutely necessary.  See page 46, Fallen Power Lines, foradditional information. If you leave your vehicle after the quake, put a note in thewindow giving your name, condition and where you have gone. 33All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 6 – Hazards/Emergency PreparednessOn a Bus or Train
Stay in your seat until the bus or train has stopped and protect your head with whatever
is available, such as a book or pillow.  Follow the instructions of the driver and remaincalm.
On a Boat or Ferry
Listen to the crew for direction.  Being on the water, as being in an airplane, is saferthan being on land during an earthquake. 
Seniors and/or Disabled
If you are able, move to a safe place in the room that you are in. If you are unable tomove quickly and safely, stay where you are and cover your head with pillows, blanketsor magazines; anything to protect your head and face. If in a wheelchair, move to anarchway or interior wall, if they are close. Be sure to lock the wheels and cover you headand neck with your hands.
AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE
TDon’t try to go home right after a major earthquake. Stay where you are until it is
safe to leave and then go to your reunion site.
TIf you’re in a coastal area and experience a large earthquake with shaking that lasts a
minute or more, move immediately to higher ground as a tsunami may be
approaching.  Check the map on page 34, Preparing for a Tsunami, to see what areasof the province are in a tsunami zone.
TCheck the building for damage, gas leaks and fires. 
TBe prepared to help others.
THang up all phones that have been shaken off the hook and stay off your phone,
cell phone and the Internet unless there is a life at stake. 
TListen to the radio or local TV station for more information and follow all
instructions.
TSUNAMIS   
Tsunami is a Japanese word meaning harbour wave. These huge waves are caused during
an earthquake when plates along the ocean floor push up against each other. This willgenerate a series of ocean waves that race outward in all directions.  A typical waveheight for pacific tsunamis is between six to nine metres at the shoreline.
Tsunamis act quite differently from tidal waves and have nothing to do with tides or the
weather. Although they move through the open ocean at intense speeds, they arescarcely noticeable, even when passing under a boat.  Their danger lies in the shallower34All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 6 – Hazards/Emergency Preparednesswater near shore where the height of the waves increases as the tsunami runs into river
and coastal channels. 
In British Columbia, there is a Tsunami Warning and Alerting Plan in place so as to
warn coastal residents.  However, if you live in a tsunami zone and feel a largeearthquake, go inland or to higher ground immediately.   
PREPARING FOR A TSUNAMI
Apart from the general preparedness rules, use thefollowing as a guide for tsunamis:
• Know the areas of the province that are at risk.
The shading on the outline map to the rightindicates those coastal areas that couldexperience a damaging tsunami generated inconjunction with either a close or distant coast 
• If you live in a tsunami zone know the local
evacuation routes to safe areas on higher ground.
• Check with your community’s local emergency
coordinator to determine how they warn of animpending tsunami (phone, door-to-door, orsiren).
DURING A TSUNAMI 
• If you’re on a boat, leave the harbour for open
water.
• If you’re in a floatplane in a harbour, take off for
a lake or land that is beyond the area of risk. 
• If on land near the ocean, leave immediately. Go to ground that is at least 15 metres
(49 ft.) above sea level.  Waves should not exceed eight metres (26 ft.) but are oftenforced up to higher ground by the pressure of subsequent waves. It may be safer toproceed on foot if there’s been a strong earthquake as roads and bridges could bedamaged.
• Check for evacuation route signs but if the community is not posted, take a route
that avoids tidal flats, the shores of coastal rivers and bay areas.
• Listen to the radio for instructions.• Wait for the “all clear” signal.• Never go to watch a tsunami.  The waves are extremely dangerous and move faster
than you can run.
35All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 6 – Hazards/Emergency PreparednessFLOODS
Flooding can be caused by several events: heavy rains alone or mixed with spring’s
melting snow can create excessive run-off on rivers and lakes. Ice jams can also causeflooding when water upstream is blocked by ice downstream and on the coast, floodingcan occur when seasonally high tides are amplified by a severe storm or tsunami. Toprepare for flooding follow the steps below.
BEFORE A FLOOD
TFind out if you live in a flood zone and identify dams in your area. 
TKnow how to prepare for an evacuation. 
TKeep important papers in watertight containers and have pictures or videos of your
property and valuables. 
TIf there is a potential for flooding in your area, pay attention to radio and television
for information and prepare your home and family.
TWatch for warning signs in your nearby environment: mudslides, debris in creeks,
colour changes in water, trees leaning or cracks developing on hillsides.
TConsider purchasing flood insurance.
WHEN FLOODING OCCURS
If rising waters become a threat to your safety, obey all officials who are involved in
rescue or flood control operations, including those directing traffic, as water can bedeeper than it appears. It only takes 60 centimetres (2 ft.) to sweep a car away and aslittle as 15 centimetres (6 in.) of moving water can cause you to fall.  Maintaining orderwill lessen the chance of personal injury to you and your loved ones. 
If Outdoors
Climb to high ground and stay there.  Avoid walking through any floodwaters.  
In a Vehicle
Take extra care when driving.  Familiar roads will appear drastically different whencovered by floodwaters. Be on the lookout for damaged bridges, slides and washouts,and be particularly alert for downed power lines. If you come to a flooded area, choosean alternate route. If your car stalls, abandon it immediately and climb to higher ground.36All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 6 – Hazards/Emergency PreparednessIn Your Home (as much as time allows )
• Be sure you know where your Emergency Supply Kit is.
• Follow your Family Emergency Plan. • Ensure that each member of your family has warm clothing and waterproof footwear
and outerwear.
• If a different meeting place than agreed on in your Emergency Plan is necessary
because of the flooding, make sure every member of your household knows wherethe new location is.  Provide the younger children with a note sealed in plasticstating the family’s destination. 
• Turn off power and unplug all appliances.
FLOOD THREAT PRECAUTIONS
To minimize flood damage to your personal property and the disruption of your day to
day life, there are certain precautions that you may take. The following suggestions applywhen there is immediate danger of flooding:
Electrical Service
Shut off power to premises.  If the main switch is in an area that is already wet, standon a dry board and use a dry stick to turn switch off.  Do not attempt to turn off powerif the room is already flooded.
Electrical Appliances
Disconnect all electrical appliances and, if possible, move them to a higher level.Thermally insulated appliances such as freezers, refrigerators and ranges should be givenpriority.  Any appliances that cannot be moved should have motors, fans, pumps, etc.removed to higher levels.
Gas or Oil Furnaces and Appliances
Oil or water tanks will float if not full.  Fill if possible, then plug vent holes.  If unableto fill, weigh down with sandbags or wedge against a solid object.  Propane gas tankswill float whether full or empty so turn off valve, disconnect tubing and plug the hole.Tie a chain or cable around the tank to anchor it and prevent it from floating away.
Plumbing Fixtures and Water Supplies
Turn off water supply.  Plug all basement sewage connections, i.e. toilet, sinks showers,etc., with a wooden plug or other device.  The plug should be held in place with aweight or wood brace to the joist above.37All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 6 – Hazards/Emergency PreparednessOther Precautions
Pesticides, weed killers, fertilizers and other articles that may cause pollution should be
moved to higher levels.  In order to relieve overloading of the sewer system, disconnectany downspouts draining to them.  Move or remove all furniture and personal effectsthat could be damaged by flooding or which may float and cause damage.
Sandbagging
Construct the sandbag dike on high ground, close to your home or building. By beingcloser to your home or building fewer sandbags will be needed and the dike will be lessexposed to any nearby streams.  Dig a trench one bag in depth and two bags wide as afoundation for the dike structure.  To be effective, a dike must be three times as wide atits base as it is high. The number of sandbags needed to protect a home or buildingvaries depending on the local topography and the anticipated depth of water.  A homeon sloping ground that needs a sandbag dike on the frontage for about 2/3 of a metre ofwater, might need about 2,000 sandbags to protect it.

Section 6 – Hazards/Emergency PreparednessLANDSLIDES and/or AVALANCHES
LANDSLIDE
This down-slope movement of soil, rock and organic materials occurs frequently in B.C.
To date, landslides account for more loss of life and property damage than other naturalhazards such as earthquakes or flooding. Over the last 100 years, 27 catastrophiclandslides have occurred. The Hope slide of 1965 was the largest of these; muddy debrismoved down one side of the valley and then all the way up the opposite valley wallwith enough material to fill a football stadium numerous times.  
The Fraser Canyon and the Trans-Canada highway are two of several  transportation
routes, which are vulnerable to landslides. Highway workers use various techniques suchas removing or bolting threatening rocks, attaching metal mesh or spraying concrete ontodangerous embankments. However, power transmission lines, gas pipelines and fiberoptic cables are also vulnerable and if damaged can impact people throughout theprovince. Landslides, rockfalls and debris flows happen quickly and with little warning.If you are caught in one, use the following safety measures:
Indoors
Stay inside and take cover under a heavy table, desk or any solid furniture and hold on.
If Outside
Try to get out of the way by running to the nearest high ground in a direction awayfrom the path of the landslide. If rocks and other debris are approaching, run for thenearest shelter such as a group of trees or a building.
If escape is impossible, curl into a tight ball and protect your head. When debris blocks
a waterway, a flood can occur.  Pay attention to radio and television and  observe nearbywater areas for signs of potential flood hazards.
AVALANCHE
Although an avalanche can occur in any season, winter is the riskiest time of year,especially following a fresh snowfall when the snow pack is settling and consolidating.  
On the Coquihalla highway, there are over 100 avalanches a year and people can be left
stranded or isolated for days. The force of an avalanche can kill anyone caught in itspath, so be very careful when travelling in avalanche areas. Use the following safety rulesas a guide:
• Check current weather forecasts and inquire about avalanche conditions.• Dress appropriately.39All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 6 – Hazards/Emergency Preparedness• Obey all warning signs, do not stop in an avalanche area and do not go into areas
that are out of bounds.
• Carry appropriate safety equipment, including items such as a whistle, small mirror
and a brightly coloured garbage bag (which also protects against hypothermia).
• If injured or lost, stay where you are.Take an avalanche awareness and rescue course if living near an avalanche area or
venturing there for outdoor activities.
Recommended Equipment for Avalanche Areas
• Avalanche shovel (lightweight/collapsible/strong)
• Survival woodsaw • Emergency probe• Transceiver  
PREPARING YOUR HOME/PROPERTY
FOR A LANDSLIDE/AVALANCHE
• Learn about the local geology, specifically the area around your home site, to identify
landslide risks. If your home is in a landslide area, determine whether you can limitdamage by erecting retaining walls. 
• If rockfalls are a danger, check with an engineer about drilling holes into the slope to
encourage easy drainage of groundwater (reducing water pressure).
• Consider using lines of trees, specific forms of vegetation and steel netting to
stabilize slopes.
• Use flexible pipe fittings for water and gas lines to lessen any damage.• Avoid activities that result in the undercutting of steep banks.• Before purchasing or subdividing land and before making construction applications,
check with your municipal or district planner or building inspector.
• Don’t build near the top or base of steep slopes, and don’t place fill on them.• If you live in an area where there is an avalanche risk, talk with your local authorities
about controlled avalanche triggering.  This is similar to methods used in ski/winterresort areas.40All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 6 – Hazards/Emergency PreparednessFOREST FIRES and INTERFACE FIRES
Fires cause extensive damage in our province every year. A lightning strike, a carelessly
discarded cigarette or an abandoned campfire are a few of the ways a forest can beturned into flames. When the fire spreads into suburban or rural areas, it’s called aninterface fire and becomes a serious threat to your family and property. Remember; youcannot outrun a fire!  
PROTECTING YOUR PROPERTY
• Keep your yard clear. Remove fallen needles, branches and long grass; anything that
could cause a fire to spread to neighbouring trees.
• Prune low-level branches up to at least two and a half metres (8 ft.) above the
ground. Replace bark mulch with gravel or decorative rocks.
• Move your woodpile, lawn furniture, tarp coverings and other combustible items
away from your house or other buildings. Flammable materials should be at least 10metres (33 ft.) away and uphill from your home and any propane or natural gastanks.
• Ensure that there are at least three metres (10 ft.) between branches and power lines.• If you live on a slope, pay particular attention to the downhill side of your property
as fire can quickly race uphill and ignite trees, grass, buildings or anythingflammable.  Thin out down-slope trees to a greater distance from your house: thesteeper the slope, the greater the distance.
• Use fire-safe building materials to give your home a rustic look without the danger of
wood siding and shake roofs. You can purchase metal shingles that look like asphaltand cement siding products that look like wood.  Non-combustible or fire-retardantmaterials should be used for your balcony and deck surfaces as well.
• Keep a hose and nozzle permanently connected and clearly visible. Make sure you
have enough hose to reach your roof and all exterior walls. If water pressure is aconcern, have a full barrel of water and a 10 litre (2 gal.) pail nearby.
• Keep a shovel or grubbing tool handy to prevent a ground fire from spreading.• Be sure your roads and driveways allow easy access for emergency vehicles. • Work together with your neighbours. Talk about a fire protection plan for your area
and organize a neighbourhood work bee.41All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 6 – Hazards/Emergency PreparednessIN AN INTERFACE FIRE
Exercise the following precautions to protect your home until you’re told to
evacuate:
• Take down flammable drapes and curtains and close all venetian blinds or non-
combustible window coverings.
• Be sure to turn off all pilot lights as well as the gas valves.• Close all doors, including interior doors and windows to prevent a draft.• Turn on one light in each room for visibility in heavy smoke.• Place valuables that will not be damaged by water in a pool or pond.• If hoses and adequate water are available, leave sprinklers on roofs and anything that
might be damaged by a fire.
IF TRAPPED IN A FOREST FIRE
• Crouch in a pond or river and cover your head and upper body with wet clothing.
• If water is not around, look for shelter in a cleared area or among a bed of rocks.
Lie flat and cover your body with wet clothing or soil.  Breathe air close to theground through a wet cloth to avoid scorching your lungs or inhaling smoke.
SEVERE STORMS
Generally speaking, staying indoors during a severe storm is your safest option and ifyou’re outdoors, take shelter wherever you can find it.  Learn the meanings of weatherterminology and listen to the weather reports each day. Pay special attention to forecastsif you have to drive during poor weather conditions.  If there is a severe storm warning,it is better not to travel until it is over. If caught outside in severe weather, use thefollowing as a guide:
THUNDERSTORM 
Take shelter in a building or depressed area such as a ditch or culvert. Don’t go neartrees, especially those standing alone.  If swimming or in a boat, get to shore as quicklyas possible.
HAILSTORM
Hail is precipitation consisting of ice pellets with a diameter of five millimetres or moreand is formed in the core of thunderstorms. Some hailstones are the size of peas whileothers can be as big as grapefruits. Take cover in a building or under something solidwhen hail begins to fall. Do not go out to cover plants, cars or garden furniture or torescue animals. Although no one in Canada has ever been killed by hail, people havebeen seriously injured by it.42All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 6 – Hazards/Emergency PreparednessLIGHTNING STORM  
If you are in a building, stay inside away from windows, doors, fireplaces, radiators,
stoves, metal pipes, sinks or anything else that could conduct an electrical charge.Unplug all TVs, radios, coffee pots and other electrical appliances.  Don’t use the phoneor other electrical equipment. 
If you are outside, seek shelter in a building, cave or any depressed area.  If there is no
shelter, crouch down with your feet close together and your head down. Don’t lie flat;minimize your contact with the ground to reduce the risk of being electrocuted by aground charge.  Keep away from pay phones, power lines, fences, trees and hilltops. Getoff bicycles, motorcycles and any other equipment such as tractors. If you are in avehicle, pull over and stop away from trees or power lines and stay inside your vehicle.
SEVERE RAINSTORM 
If outdoors, take shelter on higher ground in case of flash flooding. If in a vehicle, pullover and stay inside. 
TORNADO
Large tornadoes are rare in British Columbia, but there have been several smaller onessighted. Very few places in British Columbia appear to be completely free from risk.During a tornado take shelter in the basement or in a small, interior, ground floor roomlike a bathroom or closet.  Crouch down (duck, cover and hold) as you would in anearthquake and avoid windows.   If you live in a mobile home, take shelter elsewhere.  Ifyou are outdoors or travelling, take shelter in a ditch or culvert away from the car. Lie flatand protect your head from debris.
BLIZZARD OR SNOWSTORM 
Take shelter wherever you can.  Visibility can be virtually zero and you may easily loseyour way.  If you must travel during a blizzard or snowstorm, do so during the day andlet someone know your route and expected arrival time. 
If caught in a vehicle during a blizzard or snowstorm use the following as a guide:• Pull off the highway and put your hazard lights on.  • Hang a distress flag from the radio antenna.• Set out warning lights or flares.• Switch on your dome light rather than the headlights.• Run the engine and heater about 10 minutes each hour to keep warm.  While the
engine is running, open a window slightly and keep the exhaust pipe free of snow.Be careful not to run the vehicle battery down.
• Exercise your limbs, hands and feet to maintain body heat.  43All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 6 – Hazards/Emergency Preparedness• Huddle with passengers to stay warm. Wear your hat (you lose 60 per cent of your
body heat through your head).
• Take turns sleeping.• If stranded in a remote rural or wilderness area, spread a large cloth over the snow to
attract attention of rescue personnel or over the top of your car with the edges lockedin the windows if it is windy.
PROTECTING YOUR PROPERTY AGAINST A SEVERE STORM
If you live in an area prone to severe storms there are things you can do to keep yourhome safe:
• Prune dead or rotting branches and cut down dead trees to reduce the danger of them
falling on your house.  Contact BC Hydro to have tree limbs removed around powerlines.
• Keep the exterior of your house in good repair: roof tiles, the chimney and other
masonry need to be in good shape and eaves troughs should be cleared of debris and connected to downspouts.
•Check the drainage around your house to reduce the risk of basement
flooding after a heavy rain.
•Secure items that might be blown around or torn lose.
•Keep your car in the garage to protect against damage.
POWER OUTAGES
The main cause of power outages is accumulations of ice
on power equipment or broken branches falling on powerlines. But whether the outage is caused by a blown fuse,failure in the line equipment or a bad storm, the result isstill the same.
DURING A POWER OUTAGE
Knowing what to do during a power outage can lessen the impact on your home andcommunity.  Use the following as a guide: 
• Look out your window to see if neighbouring homes have lights on.  If they do, check
your fuse box or circuit breaker panel to see if a switch has blown.  If neighbourhoodlights are all off however, listen to your portable radio for information. This mayprevent you from having to call the power company and unnecessarily tying up thephone lines.  
44All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 6 – Hazards/Emergency Preparedness• From your home, scan the neighbourhood to look for trouble indicators, such as
flashes of light and downed wires. Do not go to these areas; call the BC Hydrorepair and outage number that is listed in the phone book.
• It’s a good idea to throw the breaker on your large appliances, such as ranges and
dryers but be sure they are already off before you throw the main household breaker
switch or remove any fuses.  
• Turn down thermostats and disconnect all electrical heaters and appliances to reduce
the initial demand when the power is reconnected. 
• Although spike suppressors (power surge bars) can provide full-time protection for
sensitive electrical equipment they are not foolproof. If you have items such as apersonal computer, microwave oven or VCR, unplug them to protect against possiblesurges when the power is restored.
• Keep doors, windows and drapes closed.
Close off extra rooms so the heat willconcentrate in one area.
• Conserve water in case electric pumps from
wells or pumping stations are out of power.Water from the taps for drinking should beokay as there will be some water left in yourhot water tank.
• Turn off all lights except one, which will alert you when the power has been
restored.
• Keep the doors of your refrigerator and freezer shut as much as possible to maintain
the cold temperature.  
• If the power is to be off for a lengthy period of time and you don’t have an alternate
heating source, take the steps listed on page 45 to protect your plumbing. 
• In very cold weather, the temperature of a house will drop about one degree Celsius
per hour. If the power is out for a long time and you have no safe way of keepingwarm, leave.  Don’t take the risk of getting hypothermia.
• If you leave your home, double check to make sure all heat-producing appliances
such as your range and iron, are unplugged.  This will minimize fire danger if poweris restored while you’re away.
• Gas appliances such as a hot water tank, fireplace or stove may continue to operate
normally if they don’t require power.  Check with your gas utilities or inspector forfurther information.
• If the power is out for less than four hours, turn on only the most essential
appliances and wait a half-hour before reconnecting others.
45All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 6 – Hazards/Emergency PreparednessIt’s not always cold when the power goes out, but if it is, here are some additional
guidelines to prevent damage to your home’s plumbing : 
• Close the water intake to your home. Protect the intake pipe, the meter or the pump
by applying covers or insulating material. 
• Drain all the pipes. Start on the top floor, opening all the taps and flushing the
toilets several times and end in the basement, opening the drainage valve. 
• Empty the hot-water tank by connecting a hose to the drainage tap of the tank so it
can empty into the basement drain. Don’t worry about small amounts of water thatmight remain in the horizontal pipes. 
• Pour a little glycol or antifreeze in the toilet bowls and the drains of the sinks and
bathtub to prevent freezing. 
POWER GENERATORS
Consider purchasing a small generator if you live in an area that experiences cold wintertemperatures or if you use life sustaining equipment. If you have a portable generator toheat your home during the power outage, be sure to connect those items that you wantto run directly to the generator; do not connect the generator to your home’s electricalsystem. 
There are two types of generators for heating your home. To avoid health and safety
problems, read the manufacturer’s instructions carefully and be aware that:
•Portable generators are not permanently connected to the power system of a
home. They can keep a limited amount of equipment operating while the mainpower is out. Users must make sure that the total load on the generator does notexceed the maximum load recommended by the manufacturer. Connect what youneed to use directly to the generator, not to your home’s electrical system. Install thegenerator outside your home or in the garage with the door open, to keep exhaustgas from infiltrating the house. Under no circumstances should portable generatorsbe used indoors including inside a garage. If the outage is more than a few days, youmay need to drain the oil; check to see if your brand is one in which you can dothis while still operating the unit.
•Permanent generators are connected to the power system of a home. During
outages, they start to work automatically (unless you have installed a manual throwswitch). Such equipment requires a specially designed interface to keep the energyproduced from leaving your house and entering the BC Hydro lines. Without thisinterface, lives may be at risk: those of the occupants of the building and those ofthe line workers working in the area. Only a professional electrician is qualified toinstall this type of generator and its interface.
• Some fuel-burning devices have a means of venting gases outdoors. If you use
these devices, make sure the exhaust is not being diverted back inside.  If you46All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 6 – Hazards/Emergency Preparednesspurchase an alternate heating device, make sure it is approved for use indoors.
Camping stoves, barbecues and any equipment approved for use inside tents, alldischarge carbon monoxide and are not designed for indoor use (even if you openthe doors and windows).  If you have a fireplace or a wood burning stove, keep asupply of wood on hand.
FALLEN POWER LINES
A fallen line may still be alive. Stay away!  Don’t try to free someone in contact with aline, call 911. Stay clear of anything that is or may be in contact with the line, like afence or a tree. If a power line falls on the vehicle you are in, stay inside until helpcomes. If it is absolutely necessary for you to leave the vehicle (because it’s on fire, forexample), jump out of it with both feet together, making sure that no part of your bodyis touching the vehicle when you hit the ground. This technique is difficult anddangerous: that’s why you should stay in the car if your life is not at risk.
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Hazardous material spills can seriously threaten the lives of anyone within the area. Usesafety precautions whenever handling dangerous items and be sure to carefully store allyour chemicals.  Factories, chemical plants, pulp and paper mills, agricultural operationsand transporters of dangerous goods represent some of the hazards outside the homeenvironment. The following suggestions can help you stay informed about the dangersaround you: 
• Find out where reportable quantities of hazardous substances are stored and used in
your community.
• Determine how close you are to freeways, railroads or factories that may produce or
transport toxic materials.
• Have materials available to seal off your residence from airborne contamination.
WHEN A HAZARDOUS SPILL OCCURS 
If you are caught outside, stay upstream, uphill or upwind. If you are in a car, close
windows and shut off ventilation. Unless the hazardous material is flammable,emergency response professionals recommend that you stay inside (shelter in place) untilyou receive instructions to leave.  
Once you are inside there are several things you can do to protect yourself:• Close all outside doors and every door inside the building.• Close all windows.• Do not use kitchen vents or bathroom vents.47All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 6 – Hazards/Emergency Preparedness• Do not use fireplaces. Close all dampers.
• Set thermostat so air conditioners, furnaces and water heaters will 
not come on.
• Do not operate clothes dryer.• Shelter in an inside room away from windows and doors if possible.• If an explosion is imminent, close drapes, curtains and shades. • Reduce or avoid smoking as it contaminates the air.• Do not use the telephone, it may tie up the phone lines.• Pay attention to local radio or TV stations for further information and follow all
instructions. 
• If you suspect gas or vapour contamination, take shallow breaths through a cloth or
towel.
• Avoid contact with any spilled liquid materials, airborne mist or condensed solid
chemical deposits.  If medical help is not immediately available and you suspectcontamination, remove all clothing and shower thoroughly.
• Place exposed clothing and shoes in a tightly sealed container preventing them from
coming into contact with other material: get directions for proper disposal from yourfire department or by calling 911.  Emergency officials can also refer you to localauthorities on how to clean up your land and property.
• Do not leave the building until told to, however if you must evacuate, shut vents
and turn off attic fans and other ventilation systems if there is time .
Well weather-stripped doors and windows slow the movement of air into the buildings
and any hazardous material that does enter is weakened when it mixes with the indoorair; it is imperative that you stay indoors (shelter in place), especially if you see a cloud,vapour, or smoke from the hazardous material outdoors or you can smell it from inside.You will be safer inside.  
VOLCANOES
There has not been an explosive volcanic eruption in British Columbia for over 2,000years, when Mount Meager blew.  Ash from the mountain travelled as far away assouthern Alberta.  We don’t usually think of volcanoes as being a hazard in BritishColumbia but in fact, the potential exists.  Several mountains that can be seen every dayare active (but “sleeping”) volcanoes:  Garibaldi, Cayley and Meager in the Whistler areaand Nazko, Kostal, Tseax, Lava Fork, Hoodoo and Edziza that stretch in a belt to theYukon border.48All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 6 – Hazards/Emergency PreparednessThe greatest potential hazard to British Columbia however, is from Mount Baker in
Washington State. Approximately 115 kilometres from Vancouver, much of the lowerFraser River valley would be at risk if Mount Baker errupted again as it did in 1870. It isunlikely that Mount Baker will erupt soon, but the possiblity does exist.
If it does, ash falling in thick layers will suffocate plants and animals, collapse buildings
and choke machinery. Ash will also wash into rivers and streams and cause them to clogwith silt and change their course. Fast-moving slurries of volcanic mudflows (calledlahars) are also a danger. They destroy and bury bridges and buildings as well as meltingsnow and ice.
It is possible that a lahar could divert the Nooksack River in Washington into the Sumas
Prairie in British Columbia. This would cause the populated and productive farming areato flood extensively. Mud and silt would then flow into the Fraser River and most likelydisrupt navigation downriver; possibly resulting in the flooding of low-lying areas.
PROTECTION FROM VOLCANIC ACTIVITY
Although you can’t prevent a volcano from erupting, being aware of its dangers may helpyou to lessen some of its effects.  Fortunately, a volcano will often give a period ofadvance warning before erupting.  This is time that can be used to prepare and evacuateto safer areas and shelters.49All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 7 – Mobile Home PreparednessSection 7
MOBILE HOME 
PREPAREDNESS 
Mobile homes are more vulnerable to outside forces than homes built on concrete
foundations.  An earthquake can knock them off their supports, a flood can lift them offand an unprotected mobile home could be heavily damaged by a severe storm. Use thefollowing precautions to lessen any potential damage to your mobile home:
• Leave the wheels on the coach to limit its fall.• Check the undercarriage to make sure that it’s been securely tied to the foundation.
Check with the manufacturer of your mobile home for information on secure tie-down systems.
• Tie double-wide mobile homes together to keep them from pulling apart. The two
halves generally are of different weights and will otherwise move differently in anearthquake or flood.   
• Seismic bracing systems are commercially available.  Be sure that any system you are
interested in has been CSA (Canadian Standards Association) certified and inspectedby the appropriate local authorities.
• Position the home near a natural windbreak such as a hill or clump of trees.  As
severe storms usually come in from the southwest, west, or northwest, the narrowend of your trailer should face in a westerly direction to make a smaller target.Emergency Preparedness WorkbookALL-HAZARD50All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 8 – After a DisasterSection 8
AFTER A DISASTER 
After a major disaster, it’s normal to feel helpless, worried, angry or even apathetic.  You
may want to be strong for others but emotional fallout is common. In the long run, youare better off sharing your distress with another supportive adult. Use the followingsuggestions as a guide to aid your recovery:
• Rest often, eat well and get as much physical activity as possible.• Keep a manageable schedule; make a list and do one job at a time.• Encourage your children to share their feelings and reassure them that they are safe. • Watch for health problems and signs of stress in yourself and all family members.• Take time off to do something you enjoy.• Accept help when others are kind enough to offer.• Share hugs liberally; the human touch is very healing. 
ADDRESSING YOUR CHILDREN’S NEEDS
Children are especially vulnerable to mental and emotional distress after a disaster. Some
effective ways of helping them to recover after a disaster are:
• After ensuring their physical safety, focus on your children’s emotional needs by
encouraging them to express their feelings.  Drawing pictures and telling stories is agood way to do this.  Listen carefully as they share and explain what reallyhappened.  Be honest and tell them of any further dangers that may still exist andthat you will work it out together.
• As with adults, hugs are reassuring; give them liberally! Tell them things will be
better again but don’t lie. 
• Include children in any necessary cleanup activities. Having a job to do refocuses
their attention on something more positive and creates a more comforting, normalenvironment.
• It is common for children to revert to immature behaviour for a few days. Some
normal reactions are irritability, anger, sadness, diarrhea, headache, nightmares, andloss of appetite.  Praise them for sharing their feelings and for helping around theEmergency Preparedness WorkbookALL-HAZARD51All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook 
Section 8 – After a Disasterhouse rather than focusing on this behaviour.  However, if it persists for more than
two weeks, seek professional advice. 
• Be aware that for a time aspects of the disaster can trigger their fears. (Such as
seeing flames or smelling smoke if there was a fire.) Talk through their fear andreassure them they are safe.
• Return to a normal schedule as soon as possible but relax the rules for a while.
• Try to spend a little extra time with them, especially at bedtime.• Work with their teachers, childcare givers, babysitters and others who need to
understand how the disaster has affected your children.
IF YOU HAD TO LEAVE YOUR HOME
If you rent or lease your home, contact the building owner or manager as soon as
possible.
Contact your insurance agent or broker as soon as possible if any expenses have been
incurred or if there is any insurance damage.  The sooner you do this the sooner yourclaim will get underway.  Most policies cover the cost of shelter, food and clothing forthe reasonable time needed to repair or rebuild your home back to policy limits.52All-Hazard Emergency Preparedness Workbook
