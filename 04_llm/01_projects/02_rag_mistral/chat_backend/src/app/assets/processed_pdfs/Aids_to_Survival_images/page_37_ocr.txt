AIDS TO SURVIVAL

Reptiles

All reptiles are edible including venomous snakes [remove the head and portion of the neck to
remove the venom glands]. Goannas being reptiles are fatty and oily so if you have to eat
these, overcook them. Remember, care must be taken when catching venomous snakes and
other reptiles, as their bite can be fatal or lead to infection.

Note:

In the period from 1980 to 2001 nine deaths have been attributed to snakebite in
Western Australia.

Marine Life

Fish are a valuable food source containing protein, vitamins and fats. All freshwater fish are
edible. It takes skill to catch fish but by considering their feeding habits and following some
simple methods you can be successful.

Where to fish
Fish frequent those places in the water where they are most comfortable and where they can
feed. The ambient temperature of the area will affect these places. You should remember â€”

e If it is hot and the water is low they will seek shaded water and deep pools. In lakes
they will retreat to deep water.

e Incold weather they will choose a shallow place where the sun warms the water and in
lakes they will keep to the edges where the water is warmer.

e If the river is in flood they will seek slack water generally on the inside of bends or in
small tributaries feeding into the main stream where the water may not be so turbulent.

e Fish and marine life like to shelter under banks or below rocks and submerged logs.

The Forked Fishing Spear

Fish can also be speared using a forked fishing spear. These are more effective than a single
pointed spear at holding a speared fish and are made from a green sapling, split at one end and
carved into two sharp prongs complete with inward pointing barbs. Before carving separate
the prongs with a wooden wedge then lash the two prongs together using cord from your
survival kit. After carving the spear can be hardened over a fire.

Tidal Fish Traps

Fish can also be trapped near the water's edge by using a fence of upright sticks or rocks
pushed into the sand close together and left in place. This type of fish trap is used by
fishermen in tropical areas with extreme tides where netting is used in place of the sticks. The
fish are trapped by the mesh of sticks or rocks and easily removed when the tide goes out.

Gathering Shellfish
A method of gathering seafood on the coast is by digging in the sand or turning over rocks for
shellfish at low tide. This is how some fishermen collect bait for line fishing.
