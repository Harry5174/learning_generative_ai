AIDS TO SURVIVAL

CHAPTER 2

Outback Survival

Survival is best defined as simply staying alive. Generally speaking survival in the outback is
a day-to-day proposition. Each day can be broken into two parts, ensuring that once the sun
rises your efforts are directed to staying alive to see it set and vice versa once the sun sets to
see it rise.

BASIC REQUIREMENTS FOR SURVIVAL
You will need four basic requirements to survive, they are -

1. Water
2. Shelter
3. Warmth
4. Food

In general the priorities will be as listed, however, in some situations you may alter them to
suit, for instance in the arid zone shelter may become number one priority if sufficient water
is available. If you have taken the precaution of notifying someone of where you are going
and how long you intend to stay a search will no doubt be conducted to look for you if you are
overdue. Your task will be to use the knowledge and skills you have to provide the four basic
requirements to stay alive until found.

Note:
Prior planning and preparation prevents poor performance.
