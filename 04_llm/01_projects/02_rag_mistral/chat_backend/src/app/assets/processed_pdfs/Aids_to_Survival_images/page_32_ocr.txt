AIDS TO SURVIVAL

LIVING OFF THE LAND

Although food is not as important as the other three requirements for survival it is necessary
for a prolonged survival situation. Any available foods should be eaten sparingly, keeping in
mind that it is better to have one meal a day than to nibble small amounts.

The average healthy adult can live for several weeks without food so this will give ample time
to locate nourishment from natural sources if necessary.

Food sources
Sources of food available to survivors include; animals, bird life, marine life, insects, grubs
and plant life.

In considering natural sources of food, there are some important points to remember

e Most animals, bird and plant life are protected and should only be used for food
sources in emergencies. Should it be necessary only kill what is needed for your
survival.

e The body needs fluid to digest food, so foods with a high water content should be
considered before others. If no water at all is available, then food should be avoided,
particularly meat, which requires more fluid to digest than vegetation.

e You do not need to be a skilled hunter to obtain food in the bush. Even without
weapons of any description enough lizards, insects and grubs can be found to keep a
person alive for several days simply by looking under rocks and dead branches, tree
stumps and anthills.

e If possible all foods should be cleaned carefully by washing, then cooked, thus
lessening the chances of any infection or stomach upsets.

e Generally bush food is tough, fibrous, unpalatable, and to some, even nauseating;
nevertheless it is food.

preferences can be divided into three classes. These are —

1st Class
marsupials - birds — fish — fowl
