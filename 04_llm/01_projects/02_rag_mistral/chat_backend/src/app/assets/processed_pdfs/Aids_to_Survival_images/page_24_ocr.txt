AIDS TO SURVIVAL

Transpiration Method

Water can be obtained by placing a clear plastic bag over the leafy branch of a non-poisonous
tree [taste-test the foliage] and securing the bag with tape at the end of the branch. Seal any
holes with tape, band-aids, etc. The action of the sun on the plastic will cause water to be
drawn from the leaves and run to the lowest part of the bag. Do not disturb the bag to collect
the water, simply cut a small hole in the bag then reseal it. The leaves will continue to
produce water as the roots draw it from the ground.

The transpiration method

The water should be drained off every two hours and stored. Tests indicate that if this is not
done the leaves stop producing water. Probably the heavy concentration of moisture-laden air
reduces the effectiveness of the sun. Ensure these bags receive maximum sunshine at all
times. Exposed roots can be tested for water content prior to bagging the tree. Soft pulpy roots
will yield the greatest amount of liquid for less effort.

Note:

A piece of cord can be tied around the bottom of the bag to form a sump and will stop
sticks, leaves and insects from contaminating the water or blocking the tapping hole. It
will also stop alkalines leaching from the foliage into the sump.

The Desert Still

Dig a hole approximately 1m x 1m x 60cm deep, line the hole with non-poisonous vegetation
and place a container in the centre with a piece of rubber tubing leading from the container
out of the hole for use as a drinking straw. Cover the hole with a clear plastic sheet and seal
around the edges with soil from the hole. The plastic sheet should be weighted with a stone
placed in the centre so it forms an inverted cone to allow condensed water to run into the
centre on the underside of the plastic and drip into the container.
