AIDS TO SURVIVAL

Gun Shots and Torch Flashes
When using gunshots or torch flashes the signals are the same as whistle signals. Remember
that guns should be discharged into soft ground, never into the air.

Signalling Mirrors

Signalling mirrors can be improvised by removing wing and rear vision mirrors from
vehicles, using the mirror on orienteering compasses [if fitted], make-up kits or using foil
from survival kits if you do not have a survival mirror or heliograph.

Signalling using an improvised hand-held mirror

Survival Signalling Mirrors

These are available commercially and are quite small at 7-5cm x Scm, they are made of 5mm
laminated glass with a sighting hole containing a special reflectorised screen that directs a
beam of sunlight onto a target. They are operated by —

1. Holding the mirror in one hand and directing sunlight onto your other hand.

2. Slowly bring the mirror up to eye level and look through the sighting hole. You will
see a bright light spot. This is the aim indicator.

3. Hold the mirror close to your eye and slowly turn and manipulate it so the bright light
spot [aim indicator] is on the target.

4. Even though no aircraft is in sight continue sweeping the horizon as mirror flashes can
be seen for many kilometres, even in hazy weather.

Ground to Air Code

This is a universal code used to communicate with rescue aircraft. The figures should be
approximately eight to nine metres in length and contrasting material such as rocks; logs or
brush should be used. Trenches in sand can also be used to throw a shadow.

Ground to air visual code for use by survivors
The ground to air code that should be used by survivors is as follows; If in doubt use
international symbol - 'SOS’

V — Require assistance

X — Require medical assistance
T - Proceeding in this direction
Y - Yes or affirmative

N - No or negative

Actions by Aircraft
e If your signals have been seen and understood the aircraft will rock from side to side
in daylight hours and flash landing or navigation lights twice at night.
e Lack of the above signals indicates that the message has not been understood

Rescue Helicopter
Never approach a helicopter on the ground. Position yourself in front but well away from the
helicopter, in view of the pilot and wait until approached by a crew-person.
