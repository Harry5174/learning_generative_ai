unprotected skin of the heat flash of a 5-megaton weapon exploded
on a clear day:

© Skin is badly burned up to 15 miles from the explosion.

@ Skin is blistered up to 18 miles from the explosion.

© Sunburn types of burns up to 23 miles from the explosion.

Nuclear explosions in the air rather than on the ground are more
likely to produce a greater number of serious burns through the
heat flash. Clothing will give some protection. A shield between
you and the light will give protection against burns from the heat
flash,

Blast

The blast wave travels more slowly than the heat flash. Several
seconds may pass after you have seen the light or felt the heat
before the blast wave reaches you, depending on the distance you
are from the explosion. It is like the time between seeing the flash
of lightning and hearing the sound of thunder. For example, at ten
miles from the centre of an explosion, it would take about 35
seconds for the blast wave to reach you. If caught in the open
during a nuclear explosion, this time can be used to find some
protection from the blast wave.

You might be injured by being thrown about by the blast; there-
fore, keep low. The greatest danger is from flying glass, bricks and
other debris. The blast from a 5-megaton explosion could injure
people as far away as 15 miles.
