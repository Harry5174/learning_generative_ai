The kinds of damage that the blast can do to buildings are:

® Complete destruction of all buildings three miles from the

centre of the explosion.

© Damage beyond repair to buildings three to five miles distant.

They would have to be torn down.

@ Major repairs required to buildings five to 10 miles distant

before they could be occupied.

@ Light to moderate damage to buildings 10 to 15 miles distant.

They could be occupied during repairs.

A 20-megaton bomb increases the approximate ranges of damage
described above to five, eight, sixteen and twenty-four miles.

These are approximate distances as the strength of buildings is
not uniform. For example, reinforced concrete buildings are more
blast resistant than wood frame structures. In some areas four miles
away from the explosion, concrete buildings might be repairable,
while wood frame buildings would be completely destroyed. Win-
dows, of course, are very vulnerable and are apt to be blown in as
far away as 25 miles from the explosion.

Radiat

A nuclear explosion causes both immediate radiation and residual
radiation.

Immediate radiation is given off at the time of the explosion. It
is dangerous only within two or three miles. If you were near the
explosion without adequate protection and managed to survive the
effects of blast and fire, you could still be seriously affected by
immediate radiation.

Residual radiation is given off by the radioactive particles left
as “fallout” after the explosion. The danger from fallout would be
so great and widespread that it is discussed separately, in Step 2.

in which you might find yourself at the time of a nuclear attack, and
