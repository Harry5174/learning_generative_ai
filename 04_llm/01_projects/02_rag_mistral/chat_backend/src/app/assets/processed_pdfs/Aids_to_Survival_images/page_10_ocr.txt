AIDS TO SURVIVAL

Recovery Equipment

A valuable accessory for getting out of bogs is the exhaust jack. This is a blow-up heavy duty
rubber/canvas bag which is placed under the vehicle and inflated by connecting it to the
exhaust pipe with the engine running. Its purpose is to jack up the vehicle on any surface.

Winches
Types of winches range from hand, electric or power take off. If you have a winch fitted to
your vehicle make sure you know how to use it. Some simple safety rules include -

e Always use a sling around an anchor point rather than forming a loop.

e Never place your hands within 1m of the drum if the winch is operating.
e Always leave six turns of cable on the drum.

e Run the engine when using an electric winch.

e Do not pull if the cable is more than 15° to either side.

Dual Battery Systems

When operating in the outback each battery should be used individually on a daily basis.
When making camp for the night the appropriate drill should be used to ensure that the
alternate battery is fully charged and will start the vehicle in the morning. The battery used for
overnight use [refrigerator, etc.] may go flat.

Fuel

Long-range fuel tanks are an excellent idea but make sure yours is fitted in the approximate
centre of the vehicle between the chassis rails. Use the rear tank first to equalise load. If you
do not have a long-range tank then 20 litre jerry cans are an excellent method of carrying fuel.
If you carry jerry cans make sure they are metal or designed to carry fuel and use tie wire on
all caps to prevent spillage.

Water

Allow 4 to 5 litres of drinking water for each person per day while travelling. If you have a
built in water tank fitted with an external tap it should be fitted with a tap guard and the tap
itself lock-wired when moving.

Emergency Pack

Enough spare food, water and blankets should be included to allow for any unforeseen delays.
Emergency rations should last at least three days on top of your planned trip. A three-day
emergency pack for each person should consist of —

e 6 ready to eat meals
e 4 litres of water
e Emergency blanket

Vehicle Loading
The loading of the vehicle is critical and the vehicle's centre of gravity kept as low as possible
always. Get in the habit of checking whenever you stop.
