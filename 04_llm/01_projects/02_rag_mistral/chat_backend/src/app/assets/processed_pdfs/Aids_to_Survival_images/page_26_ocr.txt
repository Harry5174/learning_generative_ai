AIDS TO SURVIVAL

WATER PURIFICATION

You must always ensure that the water you drink will not cause internal infection as this will
lead to further loss of fluid. You must purify any natural water that you drink by using a water
filtration device, adding sterilization tablets or by boiling it.

Note:

Salt water should never be drunk unless distilled.

Clarification of water

The water you drink should be as clear as possible. It can be left for twelve hours to settle or
strained to remove the suspended matter. A good method of doing this is to make an
improvised filter from the leg of a pair of trousers or a shirtsleeve. Into this place fine sand up
to one third the length of the filter, charcoal for the next third and fill to the top with gravel,
small stones, etc. Hang the filter in a tree or similar and pour in the muddy water. It will take a
little time but clarified water will begin to seep through the filter and drip into a container
placed underneath.

Sterilisation of water

Because the water is clear does not mean that it has no bacteria in it. To make sure of this you
must sterilise any natural water that you drink. To sterilise water you can use several methods;
the recommended method is to put in sterilisation tablets from your survival kit. The
alternatives would be to boil the water or to use other chemicals that will neutralise any
bacteria such as condies crystals or iodine from your first-aid kit.

Portable Water Filters

These are designed for the worldâ€™s diverse water conditions and usually combine a ceramic
filter with activated carbon granules. Worldwide studies have shown, that bacteria
accumulates in every activated carbon filter, which is why manufactures now put the ceramic
filter after the carbon filter thus eliminating not only micro-organisms such as Giardia,
Cryptosporidium, Salmonella, E-Coli and Cholera, but also chemicals such as chlorine and
pesticides. Most units do not de-salinate salt water, you should check this with your supplier
when purchasing.

To operate the unit, the intake hose is suspended in the untreated water. The filter is held
vertically and pumped until purified water begins to flow from the outlet. As bacteria and
particles of dirt become trapped on the surface of the ceramic filter pumping will require
greater effort. The filter should then be cleaned and not forced.
