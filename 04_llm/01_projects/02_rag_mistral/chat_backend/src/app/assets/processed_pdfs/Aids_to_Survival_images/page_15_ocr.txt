AIDS TO SURVIVAL

OUTBACK TRAVEL CODE OF ETHICS

Outback travellers should consider themselves caretakers of the land and ensure that their
actions do not add to the degradation of the landscape.

Do make sure your vehicle is in sound mechanical condition and equipped with all
necessary fuel, food, water and spares needed to complete the journey.

Do have the ability to communicate with the outside world either by radio, satellite
phone or global positioning system e-mail.

Do tell someone of your intentions. Notification of your time of departure, intended
route, campsites and estimated time of arrival at your destination may be posted at
local police stations.

Do camp in designated campsites or in natural clearings if none are available.
Do observe fire restrictions, clear around fire areas and extinguish all fires.
Don’t break or cut live branches from trees and shrubs for fires or campsites.

Don’t leave garbage in the bush. Carry garbage bags with you and remove your
waste.

Do stay on existing tracks and endeavour not to create new tracks or short cuts.
Do clear fallen trees or logs if possible rather than driving around them.
Don’t camp near stock troughs or in water catchments.

Do carry maps, information on terrain, track and weather conditions, navigation
equipment and set escape routes.

Don’t travel off-road at night. If you must travel at night use only 50% of the speed
you would use during the day and do not attempt rocky ground, mud patches or deep
water crossings.

Do know your vehicle controls so you know where they are in an emergency.
Do know the length and width of your vehicle for negotiating difficult terrain.

Don’t infringe on the privacy of aboriginal people or any settlement and be aware that
permission must be obtained to cross aboriginal reserves and communities.

Don’t carry firearms on pastoral leases without permission from the lessees.

Travellers from outside Western Australia must obtain a temporary firearms permit
from the nearest Police Station on entering the state.
