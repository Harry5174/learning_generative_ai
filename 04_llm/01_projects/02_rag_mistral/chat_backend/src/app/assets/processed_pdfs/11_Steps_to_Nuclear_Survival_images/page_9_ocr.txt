Shielding

The most effective protection is to place some heavy material
between yourself and the fallout. The heavier the material the better
the protection, Many common materials give excellent protection.
The materials and design of the fallout shelter recommended in
Blueprint for Survival No. 1 will stop penetration of 99% of outside
radiation.

‘SHIELDING

14

These thicknesses of material will stop 99% of radiation:

(a) 16 inches of solid brick;

(b) 16 inches of hollow concrete blocks filled with mortar
or sand;

(c) 2 feet of packed earth — 3 feet if loose;

(d) 5 inches of steel;

(e) 3 inches of lead;

(f) 3 feet of water.

A fallout shelter is the best way to protect your family and
yourself against radiation because:

(a) It keeps the radiation at a distance.

(b) It shields you from radiation.

(c) The time spent there is the period when radiation is most

intense.

By providing your family and yourself with a fallout shelter,

you are unlikely to suffer serious effects from radioactive fallout.

Personal Danger from Fallout

Radioactive particles in contact with your skin for a few hours
may produce burns. Follow Step 9 to prevent this danger.

Radioactive particles swallowed in food or water might be
harmful. Follow Step 9 to prevent this danger.

Radioactivity from an area of fallout may produce illness in the
unprotected individual after a few days. Follow Step 4 to prevent
this danger.

Radiation illness develops slowly. It cannot be spread to other
people. Except for temporary nausea shortly after exposure,
evidence of serious effects from radiation may only appear after an
interval of from a few days to three weeks. A combination of loss of
hair, loss of appetite, increasing paleness, weakness, diarrhoea, sore
throat, bleeding gums and easy bruising indicate that the individual
requires medical attention. Nausea and vomiting may be caused by
fright, worry, food poisoning, pregnancy and other common con-
ditions.
