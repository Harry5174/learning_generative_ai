First Aid Hints
General Rules:

Keep calm.

Keep the injured person lying down in a comfortable position,
his head level with his body until you determine whether his in-
juries are serious.

Examine for stoppage of breathing, serious bleeding or broken
bones. These must be treated immediately before any attempt is
made to move the injured person. Do not be hurried into this unless
you are in a situation of extreme danger.

Keep him comfortably warm with blankets or other coverings,
under and above the patient.

Never attempt to give a semi-conscious or unconscious person
anything to drink.

Unconsciousness

An unconscious patient lying on his back may be strangled by
his own tongue which will tend to fall back and obstruct the airway.
All unconscious persons should be placed lying half over on their
faces, (three-quarter-prone position).

If the patient is breathing quietly and easily and his lips are pink
