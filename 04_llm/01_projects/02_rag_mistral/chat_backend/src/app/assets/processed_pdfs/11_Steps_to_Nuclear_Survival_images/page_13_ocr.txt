quick reach, lie face down in it and cover your face with your arms.
Make sure this shelter is not too close to buildings which could
collapse into it.

“After” the blast and heat of the explosion, you would have to
find other protection against fallout which will come down later.
(Don’t forget your battery-powered radio).

None of these improvisations is as good as a properly equipped
blast shelter, but any single one of them could mean the difference
between life and death.

Improvised Protection Against Fallout

You may not have a fallout shelter when warning of approaching
fallout is broadcast. Here are some tips on how to increase your
protection in a basement. The amount of protection you can build
will depend on how much time you have available until fallout
arrives.

@ You can improvise a small emergency shelter by using furni-
ture, doors, dressers, work-bench and other materials.

@ Select a corner of your basement, if possible away from
windows, in which to build your shelter. Remove inside house
doors from hinges to use as a shelter roof over supports.
Supports for the improvised roof can be cabinets, chests of
drawers, work-bench, or anything which will bear a heavy
load. Use the house doors as a roof surface to provide a base
for the heavy material you will have to place on it. Bricks,
concrete blocks, sand-filled drawers or boxes, books or other
dense items on the roof will help reduce radiation penetration.
Around the sides and front of your shelter build walls of dense
materials to provide vertical shielding. A small cabinet or
dirt-filled box as may be used as a crawl-in entrance which
can be closed behind you.

@ Remember, the heavier or more dense the material around you,
the greater the protection.

© Block basement windows with earth, bricks, concrete blocks,
books or even bundles of newspaper. In winter, use packed
snow.
