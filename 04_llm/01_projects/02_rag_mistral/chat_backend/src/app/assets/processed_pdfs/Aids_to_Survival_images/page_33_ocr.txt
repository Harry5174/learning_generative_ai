Animals and Reptiles

The presence of any animal or bird life in an area is evident by tracks, droppings and traces of
fur or feathers. If you have been lucky enough to find a waterhole used by animals it is a
simple matter to sit under cover, down-wind from the water source and either shoot or snare
the animals as they come to water.

Even by walking through the bush quietly during the day it is possible to surprise sleeping
animals in creek beds, under shady trees and amongst rocky outcrops.

Some of the most likely animals seen in the bush include kangaroos, small marsupials, wild
goats, donkeys, pigs, rabbits, snakes, lizards, frogs, sheep and cattle.

Some imagination and bushcraft skills are needed in knowing where to look, how to recognise
tracks and how to snare the faster moving animals.

SNARING ANIMALS
Without a firearm or manufactured animal trap most animals can be snared with a wire noose

placed in a convenient position such as the entrance to a hole or above an animal path
between two trees.

The noose should slide freely and the other end of the wire should be anchored securely to a
tree or post. As the animal passes through, the noose tightens around the neck quickly killing
it as it tries to pull free. This type of trap is generally successful at night when the animal
cannot see the snare. Care should be taken not to leave any human smell on the wire.

Owing to the cruel nature of the snare, it should only be used when other methods fail.

If setting a snare look for signs of fur around a tree's base or signs along a fence line to
indicate where an animal has passed through. Animals will return to the same place to sleep
and will continue to negotiate fences at the same spot.
