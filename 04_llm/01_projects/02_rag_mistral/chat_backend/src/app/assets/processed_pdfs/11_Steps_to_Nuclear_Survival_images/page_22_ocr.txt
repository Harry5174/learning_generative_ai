KNOW HOW TO GET RID
OF RADIOACTIVE DUST

In Step 2, fallout was described as “sand”. To remove the
danger, remove the sand. If you suspect that your clothes have
fallout on them, remove your outer clothing before you come
inside your home and leave it outside. Don’t shake these clothes
inside the house or shelter. You would only scatter the fallout grit
and create unnecessary danger to others. If you have water, wash
thoroughly, particularly exposed skin and hair. But do not scrub
your skin as this might rub in the radioactive particles.

Exposure to fallout does not make you radioactive.

Even if you are stricken with radiation sickness, this sickness
cannot be passed on to others.

Fallout on your clothing or body would expose you and those
close to you to radiation. If you suspect you have been exposed to
fallout, you will not be a danger to others if you carefully get rid
of your outer clothing outside the shelter and wash.

Food and Water

Since most of your food will be in tightly covered containers
(cans, bottles, plastic, boxes), it will all be safe to eat or drink if
you dust the containers. Food, if it is unspoiled and free of grit
or dust, may be eaten during the emergency period.

Be sure to wash fruit and vegetables and peel carefully.

Water will be safe7if it is in covered containers, or if it has come
from covered wells, or from undamaged water systems.
