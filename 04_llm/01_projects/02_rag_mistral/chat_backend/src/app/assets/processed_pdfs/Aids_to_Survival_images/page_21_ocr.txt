THE IMPORTANCE OF WATER TO SURVIVAL

In Western Australia people do die after becoming lost or having their vehicle break down in
the remote and arid areas of the state. During the period from 1983 to 1999 forty-three people
have perished due to excessive heat, thirst and exposure. Many of these deaths occurred
because the individuals did not carry out good survival techniques.

The average person can expect to survive without water for three to five days [depending on
the climate and what they try to do]. Some instances show individuals have perished within
hours of becoming lost.

You must conserve any water you have, including that already in your body. Water is required
to replace fluid that is lost, so by conserving body fluid you require less water intake.

Time frame for survival

There have been cases where, in an ambient temperature of 38°C survivors have stayed in the
shade and followed good survival principles and survived for the following periods when in
possession of the nominated amount of water. The table below is included to highlight the
importance your actions may have on your time frame for survival.

No water 1 litre 2 litres 5 litres 11 litres
3-5 days 5’ days 6 days 7 days 9 days

How fluid is lost from the body
Fluid is lost from the body by perspiring, breathing, urinating, vomiting, crying and talking.

Perspiring

Perspiration is a mixture of salt and water with the amount of salt varying from person to
person. It is a normal bodily process that has a cooling effect as moisture evaporates from the
skin surface. A person resting in the shade when the temperature is 35°C would lose about 2
litres of fluid in a 24-hour period. It is important to keep activity down to a minimum and
conserve existing body fluids as any rise in body temperature can see losses in excess of |
litre of fluid per hour resulting in dehydration.

Urinating

Is also a normal bodily process and cannot be prevented. However, it should be held as long
as possible to slow down this fluid loss from the body. On no account drink urine unless it has
been distilled. You could apply it to the skin surface with a sponge, in the hope that it will
reduce your body temperature.

Vomiting
Can generally be avoided by leaving bad or harmful food well alone.

Crying
Should also be avoided, but it may be difficult to convince a child of this.

When to consume water in a survival situation

You should always drink to replace fluids lost from your body however if you are unable to
locate or procure water and are limited to the water in your survival kit it should be consumed
in small sips to replace some of the fluid lost to your system. This water will increase your
time frame for survival by up to half a day.
