AIDS TO SURVIVAL

VEHICLE SELECTION

Selection of a suitable vehicle for safe outback travel will rely on the load that you are going
to carry. As well as major items of fuel, food and water you may also be carrying camping
equipment, cooking gear, vehicle spares, tools, recovery equipment, an extra spare tyre and
passengers. If you choose to travel 'off road' you will need to be sure your vehicle can
withstand the harsh and rugged conditions you will encounter.

VEHICLE PREPARATION

Your vehicle will not only be your means of transport but if you are travelling ‘off road’ it will
be your home and of course your biggest aid to survival should something unforeseen happen
to you. As such it must be in first class mechanical condition.

If you are not a mechanic it is best to take the vehicle to one who specialises in this type of
vehicle. Explain the nature of your trip and have them go over the vehicle from top to bottom.
Short courses in vehicle maintenance are offered by most community, TAFE Colleges, etc.

Roof Racks
To carry the intended load you will probably need to install a roof rack. Buy only from a
reputable manufacturer who specialises in your type of vehicle.

Under Body Protection Plates

These are considered necessary by some people for rocky creek crossings, etc. They can be a
problem in spinifex country as after only a few kilometres' spinifex packs tightly under the
plate and creates a definite fire hazard.

Roo and Scrub Bars
These are not essential items for off-road travel but they can be good value should you be
unlucky enough to hit a kangaroo or other large animal.

Spinifex Protection
Some spinifex grows to a height of nearly 2m and the seeds can be drawn into the radiator. At
least 3 layers of fibreglass wire netting should be placed over the front of the vehicle.

Fire Extinguishers
It is good planning to carry at least 5 litres of water in a plastic garden spray for spinifex and
grass fires as well as an extinguisher suitable for electrical or fuel fires.

Tyres

It is important to discuss your tyres with your local tyre dealer before your trip. Ensure you
have the right tyres for the task. Eight ply radials are recommended as a minimum for off-road
use. Two spares plus an additional 2 tubes should be carried.

Wheel Rims

It is easier to change a tyre on a split rim than on a pressed safety rim or alloy rim so stick
with the standard steel split rim if possible otherwise a specially designed bead-breaker should
be carried for removing tyres from rims and replacing them.
