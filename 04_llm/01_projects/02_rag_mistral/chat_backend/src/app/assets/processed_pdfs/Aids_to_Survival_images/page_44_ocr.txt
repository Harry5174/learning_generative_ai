AIDS TO SURVIVAL

Direction Finding

If stranded it is best to stay with your vehicle or aircraft as searchers will find this easier to
locate than a lone person. When you have become isolated from a walking party however and
find yourself lost without a compass you will have to know how to navigate without map or
compass to proceed on your pre-set escape route to safety.

Sun Movement

The sun’s position north or south of the equator is called declination. It is furthest north on
June 21, crosses the equator on September 21, is farthest south on December 21 and re-
crosses the equator on it’s way north on March 21. Any east-west line indicated when the sun
crosses the equator on the 21 March and the 21 September will be accurate.

WATCH METHOD

To find north using your watch simply -
1. Stand holding your wristwatch horizontal with the figure 12 pointing at the sun
2. Bisect the angle between the hour hand and the 12 O'clock position
3. The line will indicate north [approximately]

Direction-finding using a wrist watch

Note:

This method will not apply to areas north of the Tropic of Capricorn during the period
of the midsummer equinox for your area.

BUSHMAN’S METHOD

Early settlers often gained a rough estimate of south by remembering that kangaroos rested in
areas of shade during the heat of the day. They were aware of signs of disturbed earth where
the kangaroos scooped out a hollow in the shade of low bushes. As we are in the southern
hemisphere the shade areas were always on the southern side of the bushes.

Note:

This method is still applicable and may provide an easy method of direction finding in
some areas.
