AIDS TO SURVIVAL

CHAPTER 4

Emergency Procedures

In the interests of prior planning and preparation those who live, work or travel in the outback
of Western Australia should be prepared for any foreseeable emergency whether they are on
foot or in a vehicle. ‘Actions on’ should be planned and the knowledge and skill to carry them
out should be acquired through training.

A personal first aid kit and a personal survival kit should always be carried, notifications
should always be posted and safe practices must be a priority.

PROCEDURE IF LOST

If you do become lost, try to remain calm as panic will put you at a psychological
disadvantage, the situation is not as hopeless as you may think.

If by any chance you have taken the wrong track and do not know where it is going to lead
you, it is pointless going on any further. It would be safer to return the way you came by
retracing your tracks back to a point where you can establish your location.

Case histories reveal that most people, when lost push on blindly in a state of panic, hoping
that they might end up ‘somewhere’. In these cases their efforts either take them further away
from civilisation or around in circles. Do not under estimate the huge vastness and great
distances of our Western Australian outback.

In a vehicle

If in a vehicle stay with or near your vehicle as it is a source of shelter and water [provided
there are no chemical additives in the radiator]. Also it is easier for search parties to locate a
vehicle than to locate a solitary human wandering around somewhere in the bush.

If you have to leave your vehicle temporarily to search for food or water mark your trail on
the ground with sticks or stones so you can find your way back. Otherwise you may find it
hard to locate your vehicle once it is out of sight. Only walk in the cool part of the day to
minimise fluid loss and exposure to the sun.

On foot
If on foot once you decide you are lost consult your map and use it in conjunction with your
recollection of the country you have traversed to try to identify a feature.

You can retrace your route to your last known position, or you can make for higher ground in
an attempt to fix your position.

If you are operating with a pre-set escape route and all attempts to fix your position have
failed then you should proceed on the bearing to safety.

If none of the above options apply then you should stay where you are, set up camp and wait
for rescue.
